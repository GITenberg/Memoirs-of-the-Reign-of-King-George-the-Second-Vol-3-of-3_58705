<p>April 5th.&mdash;Lord Holderness went to Lord
Temple to notify to him his dismission. Legge prevailed
on Pitt and the rest not to resign, but to be
turned out. The Duke of Devonshire had offered
Legge to remain; but though he was never tardy
at abandoning his friends for a richer prospect,
nobody was more steady when it would hurt him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
desert. The next night, Mr. Pitt was discarded:
and then George Grenville and the others resigned.
Charles Townshend alone took time to consider:
the income of his place was large, and he did not
love Pitt. After an uncertainty of near three
weeks, he resigned; but by a letter to the Duke of
Devonshire avoided as much as possible to have it
thought that he quitted from attachment to Pitt.
Resigning with him, and not for him, Townshend
thought entitled him to be restored with Pitt, yet
would not subject him to the King’s displeasure.</p>

<p>All men were curious to see the new Administration.
None was formed. Lord Egremont had consented
to accept the Seals of Secretary of State, but
soon desired to be excused. He had miscarried
with Lord Granville, had not succeeded better by
assiduous court to Newcastle, and now attaching
himself to Fox, had his hopes soon blasted with this
blossom of an Administration. Doddington, who
had gone in and out too often to lose any reputation
by one more promotion or disgrace, was ready
to take anything. Sir George Lee, who could not
give up the hopes of being Prime Minister, though
never thought of but when he could not be so, prepared
to accept the Chancellorship of the Exchequer;
and Lord Winchelsea, uniform in detesting the
Grenvilles, immediately entered upon his old office,
the Admiralty, with a motley board, composed of
Boscawen, (one of the last set,) Rowley, (of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
foregoing,) Moyston, his own nephew, Lord Carysfort,
and young Sandys. Elliot was offered to
remain, but refused; and W. Gerard Hamilton was
designed for the seventh.</p>

<p>Yet an Admiralty did not make an Administration.
No man of abilities or reputation would enlist&mdash;even
Sir Thomas Robinson refused to take the
Seals again. Yet the Duke embarked with satisfaction,
telling Mr. Conway, the King could not be
in a worse situation than he had been&mdash;“Yes, Sir,”
said Conway, “but he will, if Mr. Pitt gets the
better.” And Fox, to gratify at least some of his
views in this revolution, procured a grant for himself
and his two sons of the reversion of Doddington’s
place of Clerk of the Pells in Ireland. The
King had forbidden the Duke, who negotiated this
business, to mention the Peerage for Lady Caroline,
which he would never grant; but he would give
him Doddington’s place for his child&mdash;“Say
children, Sir,” replied the Duke. “With all my
heart,” said the King; “it is the same thing to
me.” He cared not how many reversions he
granted from his successor. Still it was impossible
for Fox himself to accept any ministerial post till
the inquiries were at an end; the whole tempest
would have been directed at his head.</p>

<p>Indeed many had such intentions: at a meeting
of Pitt’s friends and the Tories, it was agreed to
push the scrutiny into the military part with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
vehemence. Charles Townshend accepted the
office of manager: and George, on moving for more
papers, made severe remarks on the want of miners
at Minorca; which Fox excused, saying, it was
hoped that the Minorchese, who had assisted in
digging the mines, would have contributed to their
defence. To keep miners there on the establishment
had been thought too expensive. “Are they
more expensive to the Government,” replied
Townshend, “than sinecures?” alluding to Fox’s
new reversion. Pitt, at the meeting I have mentioned,
promised his support, but feared he should
not be able to speak five minutes for his cough.
He was aware that Newcastle had left too little
power to Fox in their joint Administration, for it to
be possible with any degree of decency to brand the
one, and slide over the errors of the other, with
whom Pitt wished to unite. Yet the temper
of the nation left him master to take whatever
resolution he pleased. The rashness of throwing
Government into imminent confusion at such a
juncture, struck both the enemies and friends of
Fox. His ambition was glaring; his interestedness,
not even specious. Pitt had acted during his
short reign with a haughty reserve, that, if it had
kept off dependents and attachments, at least had
left him all the air of patriot privacy; and having
luckily from the King’s dislike of him, and from
the shortness of the time, been dipped but in few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
ungracious businesses, he came back to the mob
scarce</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">“&mdash;&mdash; shorn of his beams.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>The stocks fell; the Common Council voted the
Freedom of the City both to Pitt and Legge;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Sir
John Barnard alone gave a negative. Allen of
Bath procured them the same honour from thence;
and for some weeks it rained gold boxes: Chester,
Worcester, Norwich, Bedford, Salisbury, Yarmouth,
Tewkesbury, Newcastle-on-Tyne, Stirling, and other
populous and chief towns following the example.
Exeter, with singular affectation, sent boxes of
heart of oak. On the other hand, a paper was
affixed to the gate of St. James’s, with these words,
“A Secretary of State much wanted; honesty not
necessary; no principles will be treated with.”</p>

<p>Such venom was not likely to bias Newcastle to
Mr. Fox. It was the King’s wish that they should
unite; and many messages passed; but in vain. It
was pretended that the Duke had promised his
Majesty never to join Pitt, unless by command.
The King said, he would abdicate sooner than
give him such command; and complaining bitterly
of his ingratitude; imputing to him a refusal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
made by Lord Duplin to be made Chancellor of
the Exchequer; and his leaving his Majesty at
the mercy of Mr. Pitt, by not uniting with Fox.
His Grace, who scrupled not to wipe out one
imputation by deserving another, wrote a penitential
letter, and sent it by Munchausen, lamenting
his disgrace, after so many years of service,
and hoping, when the inquiries should be at an
end, that he might again have admission to the
closet, where he should be ready to protest and
promise whatever his Majesty expected. He had
scarcely written this letter, but he laboured anew to
obstruct the junction of his friends with Fox.
In general, they outran his intentions: Lord Lincoln
hated Fox; the little tools feared him. Murray
and Hume Campbell and Arundel sincerely
wished to bring them together.</p>

<p>The Princess, who looked on any settlement in
which Fox was concerned as an establishment of
the Duke’s power, frowned on the new revolution;
and though Fox made very humble overtures to
Leicester House, they were flatly rejected. Pitt
grew less and less austere to Newcastle; and now,
when this vain man was arrived at the period of
detected misgovernment with regard to his country,
of ingratitude and disobedience to his master, of
caprice, duplicity, and irresolution towards all factions;
when under prosecution by Parliament, and
frowned on by his sovereign; at this instant were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the hopes, the vows of all men addressed to him!
The outcast of the Ministry, the scorn of the
Court, the jest of the people, was the arbiter of
Britain: her King, her patriots, her factions,
waited to see into what scale he would fling his
influence!</p>

<p>In the meantime, the inquiries began, April 19th.
I shall give but a summary account of them: it
would be ridiculous to enter into the detail of a pantomime,
from which nothing was intended, expected,
or produced. The Townshends pretended to be managers
against the Ministers: Hume Campbell and
Lord Royston acted with spirit and sense for their
friends: Ellis was agent for Fox. The latter himself
meddled a little, pointing out where inconveniences
might arrive to Government from probing
intelligence too nicely. The examination began
with reading all the papers in order; intelligence,
letters, orders, &amp;c. But no kind of check had been
held over the offices from whence the materials
came. The clerks had been left at liberty to omit,
abridge, secrete, what they pleased. No questions
were asked, no proofs of authenticity demanded, no
witnesses examined; and, for fear of discovering
our channels of intelligence, no names were inserted
in the extracts. And as the offices had been suffered
to curtail at their discretion, so they had had
as impartial liberty to send as much useless and
perplexing lumber as they could amass. The very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
dates of the letters filled three and twenty sheets
of paper! All this was read over in a hurry, yet
was so tiresome, that before half a day was wasted,
the House was almost empty. Yet three or four
hundred men were supposed to extract a judgment
from so crude and slovenly a process!</p>

<p>Pitt, it was expected, would take advantage of
illness, and not appear. But he refined on that old
finesse; and pretending to wave the care of a broken
constitution, when his country demanded his service,
and as a pledge of his sincerity in the scrutiny, he
came to the discussion in all the studied apparatus
of a theatric valetudinarian. The weather was
unseasonably warm; yet he was dressed in an old
coat and waistcoat of beaver laced with gold: over
that, a red surtout, the right arm lined with fur,
and appendent with many black ribands, to indicate
his inability of drawing it over his right arm, which
hung in a crape sling, but which, in the warmth of
speaking, he drew out with unlucky activity, and
brandished as usual. On his legs were riding
stockings. In short, no aspiring Cardinal ever
coughed for the Tiara with more specious debility.
This mummery was covered over with candour: he
acquiesced in every softening term proposed by the
advocates of the late criminals: his justice shrunk
behind apprehensions of personality: moderation
was the sole virtue of a censor. The loss of Minorca
he avowed he meant to charge on the whole Government&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the whole Government could not be
punished. On the second day, indeed, he trespassed
a little upon all these gentle virtues, and threatened
to <em>secede</em>, and publish to the world the iniquity of
the majority: but recollecting how much more useful
to him the majority might be than the world,
he recomposed himself, and was content that the
majority should be responsible for whatever defects
the public might find in the judgment given by
the House.</p>

<p>George Townshend proposed several resolutions:
the drift of all was to show that the Administration
had chosen to believe a threatened invasion on
Great Britain, rather than a design on Minorca.
These motions were contested, modified, balanced,
by appendent questions proposed by the Courtiers.
Henley, the Attorney-General, scrupled not in the
very outset to propose approbation. Pitt said he
should prefer printing the examination, and leaving
the public to judge for themselves. Hume Campbell
pleaded that such procedure in the House of
Commons would be abdicating their share of Government.
The Ministerial party endeavoured, though
with ostentatious decency, to load the late Admiral;
but in general their arguments tended to nothing
but to prove that <em>Minorca had been lost by the
common course of office</em>. The questions of the
Opposition were corrected till all sting was taken
out of them; and still others were coupled to them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
that made the votes of the House seem a mere set
of questions and answers, in which the whole advantage
remained to the respondent.</p>

<p>These things passed not without divisions, but
as the majority felt itself a majority, it was not
modest; it stated roundly in favour of its principals.
Yet on the last day of the Committee, the
Courtiers moving a resolution, that no greater force
could have been sent to the Mediterranean under
Mr. Byng, Triumph itself blushed at so palpable a
falsehood, and the victorious majority shrunk to 78,
many retiring, and many of the more independent
sort joining the minority. By this might be seen
what Mr. Pitt had in his power, had he exerted
himself. The alarm, however, was so great, that a
conclusive vote of acquittal, nay, of approbation,
which it had been determined should be proposed
by Lord Granby and Lord George Cavendish, was
dropped with evident marks of dismay; and the
late Cabinet, to their great disappointment, were
forced to sit down contented, without receiving the
thanks of the House of Commons for the loss of
Minorca.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the inquiries, however, from
which at least it had been supposed a new Administration
would arise, facilitated nothing. No approbation
given pointed out nobody as deserving power
again: nobody being stigmatized, nobody seemed
excluded. Pitt had declined triumph, consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
had gained none. A field of negotiation was still
open, till three men who knew, hated, and could
not trust one another, might settle some such plan
of agreement as would still leave those who should
unite the hopes and the prospect of betraying or
overpowering their new allies.</p>

<p>In the meantime, as if to show how long a great
nation can carry on itself without any Government,
there were no Ministers, even in the midst of a formidable
war, but those baby politicians, the Duke
of Devonshire and Lord Holderness: the former
with much importance declaring, that he would
retain the Treasury but till some new system should
be completed: yet he was delighted with the plaything
of power, and wished his holidays might be
protracted. For the King himself, his very office
seemed annihilated. While the three factions were
caballing, he had not even an option. Whatever
Administration should be settled, he was to receive
when presented to him. Lord Mansfield held the
Seals of the Exchequer <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tempore</i>; and the
House of Commons was so devoid of a Minister,
that the office of proposing the Ways and Means
devolved on Nugent, one of the Lords of the Treasury.</p>

<p>The House of Lords were employed on the militia.
Lord Hardwicke opposed, but would not divide
against it. The Duke of Bedford and Lord Temple
joined to support it; and it passed at last by 64 to 48.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>While this ridiculous scene was acting at home,
our foreign affairs wore a more respectable aspect.
Count Rantzau, the Danish Minister, mentioned to
Lady Yarmouth, on the part of France, a neutrality
for Hanover. She discreetly refused to meddle in
it. He then, in concert with the Minister of the
Empress-Queen, proposed it in form, but the terms<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
were so humiliating, that the King rejected them
with dignity and scorn. In truth, as Elector, his
situation deserved compassion. At this instant, the
French had seized in their own name the county of
Bentheim, a purchase his Majesty had made himself:
the rest of his territories they pretended to
hold for the Empress-Queen. Under this depression,
news came of a great victory obtained by the King
of Prussia over the Austrians. He had planned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
his measures with such intelligence, that he previously
ventured to send the King word, that he
should make four attacks at once on the quarters
of the enemy, and expected to find them unprepared.
He confirmed his designs by success, carried every
attack, possessed himself of their magazines, and
when he dispatched the courier, was within thirty
miles of Prague, hoping to be master of Bohemia
by the 15th of the month, and to be able to detach
a body of twenty-five thousand men to support the
Duke of Cumberland. The Austrian Generals disagreed;
their Foot behaved ill: in general, their
troops thought the Prussians irresistible.</p>

<p>The Hero-King, who dared to prophesy, because
he left so little to chance, pursued his blow; Marshal
Brown retiring to the other side of Prague.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
The King of Prussia with a strong Army on one
side, Marshal Schwerin at the head of another from
behind, fell on Brown at once, forced his camp, and
took it with all his tents, baggage, and 250 pieces
of cannon. Prince Charles, Brown, and Lucchesi,
were wounded, and shut up in Prague. The King
of Prussia lost little in numbers, exceedingly in one
man, Marshal Schwerin, who making his attack
before his second line was formed, and seeing his
first line repulsed, seized a pair of colours, and fell
with them in his hand. The glory of the day, that
thus remained indubitably with the King, did not
recompense him for the loss of such a servant.</p>

<p>The primate of Ireland, who suspected that he
should have little part in the Bedford Administration,
had stayed in England to negotiate between
Newcastle and Pitt, hoping that if Fox was entirely
set aside here, the Duke of Bedford might in pique
resign his new empire before he took possession of
it; at least, would not be countenanced in any depression
of him (the Primate). Lord George Sackville
laboured in the same cause; and about the
second week in May an interview was brought
about between Pitt and Lord Hardwicke&mdash;as the
latter said, <em>by chance</em>. Pitt insisted that Newcastle
should not interfere in the House of Commons,
nor with the province of Secretary of State;
that is, with neither domestic nor foreign affairs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
but should confine himself to the Treasury; yet
there too Pitt pretended to place George Grenville
as Chancellor of the Exchequer, with Potter and
James Grenville. Legge, whom he meant to remove,
having conceived insuperable aversion to
him since harnessed with himself in the trammels
of popularity, he named for the head of the Admiralty,
with a Peerage. For Lord Temple he demanded
the Garter and some Post in the Cabinet.
The terms were lofty; yet considering his interest
in the people, and his experience of Newcastle’s
engrossing chicanery, he was justifiable in endeavouring
to clip the wings of so volatile a constitution.</p>

<p>The death of the Duke of Grafton, who had so
often transacted Newcastle’s variations, arrived
now to facilitate his re-establishment. The Duke
of Devonshire was charmed with the bubbles of the
Chamberlain’s office, and in three days accepted the
White Stick and Golden Key, leaving the Treasury
open. Yet in a week more the treaty between
Newcastle and Pitt was broken off. Newcastle
had negotiated for support, not for a master.
Lord Hardwicke, notwithstanding his predilection
for Pitt, owned that Fox was the more practicable:
and George Grenville, finding that the coalition was
impeded by what was demanded for him, desired to
wave the Exchequer. But Pitt, not apt to bend to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
difficulties, replied to this concession, that it became
Mr. Grenville to make it, but he himself
should not relax.</p>

<p>During this parley, the King demanded support
from the two Houses. Lord Waldegrave moved
the Address, and a million was proposed. Lord
Temple would have reduced it to 300,000<em>l.</em> Lord
Holderness pleaded his Majesty’s noble refusal of a
neutrality for Hanover, and the claim he had to
assistance. Lord Temple would have restricted
the money to English purposes. The Duke of Bedford
supported the Motion of the Court, reflected
on Pitt’s all-sufficience, and the Address passed
without a division. In the other House it occasioned
a good Debate, though no division. Nugent
expatiated on the King’s merit to Britain: that
he had said, “While Europe is in danger, Hanover
shall not be safe.”</p>

<p>Pitt dropped several artful sentences, hostile to
those that had been or might be Ministers, convertible
into excuses for himself, if he should again
become a Minister. He said, he should not oppose
the gross sum upon any foot but on the gift being
offered without an iota of restriction: that indeed
he had predicted his own fate when he acted on the
restrictive plan: that he would support whoever
had contributed to set this Government going
again: that everybody was free to speak his sentiments
on this measure, for no man could tell who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
would be Minister, who would be trusted with this
million: that if it was to be confined to Great
Britain and America, he would consent to give a
million: but now this might be dispensed to the
troops of Hanover, though we had already given
them 200,000<em>l.</em> He had heard of his own all-sufficience;
he knew our insufficience. This might be
the plan of a few great Lords who did not mind
tossing in one or two hundred thousand pounds
more: but the people had lost all confidence, seeing
how surreptitiously their money was taken and
given.</p>

<p>He would not ask a question on the victory, the
news of which were arrived that morning&mdash;he did
not wish to relax, because the King of Prussia was
successful. That King, who saw all, did all, knew
all, did everything, was everything! If you would
deal with such great masses, and not take little
things, and think they would make a great one,
there might still be hopes&mdash;don’t go on subsidizing
little Princes here and there, and fancy that all
together they will make a King of Prussia. That
Prince had never asked a subsidy, at least while
he had had any part in the Administration; yet
had raised the spirits of everybody, who hoped for
a decent end of the war; for they were offensive
operations that must bring about a peace. For the
King, he said, though his Majesty did not serve so
absolutely for nothing as the King of Prussia did,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
nor were the coffers of Hanover so exhausted but
they might stop a gap till next winter, yet their
Majesties had gone hand in hand together: but he
dreaded the war being transferred to Flanders&mdash;<em>he
had rather feed it in Germany</em>. If the King’s
Hanoverian ministers had been negligent in their
preparations, this victory would not repair their
remissness: the Duke’s authority must fetch up
their negligence.</p>

<p>He hoped the Ministers would not go to market
this summer for German Princes, with whom we
should find ourselves hampered next winter. Had
any illumination broken in upon that poor piddling
plan, which carried the approbation of a whole nation
along with it? The King of Prussia with
170,000 men was worth giving one or two hundred
thousand pounds to&mdash;but don’t let a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conciliabulum</i>
of Ministers, when they happen to dine together,
settle another subsidiary plan, at once minute and
extravagant. Were he Minister, he would have
deprecated this measure, nay, would have said more
against it, than he would say in the House of Commons.
He added some hints on his own popularity,
and on the independence of the country gentlemen
who favoured him. Fox took up some of Pitt’s expressions:
if a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conciliabulum</i> might not decide our
measures, he hoped at least <em>one</em> man should not dictate
them. With regard to independence, he supposed
every man there was independent&mdash;but who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
were these particularly applauded for their independence?
Were they those, who, two years ago,
lay under the irremissible crime of being Tories?
or, who this year had the unknown merit of being
so? These and other taunts drew on some warmth.
Conway, too, offended Pitt by vindicating the Duke
of Devonshire, whom Pitt had seemed to censure as
concerned in what he called <em>this surreptitious vote
of credit</em>. Lord George Sackville naturally closed
with Pitt, when Conway seemed to debate with
Fox:&mdash;Charles Townshend and Lord Egmont had
another squabble; and at last the million was voted.
In one of the Debates at this time, Pitt talked much
on Ximenes, who, he afterwards owned to Fox, was
his favourite character.</p>

<p>Another Bill, brought in by George Grenville on
a good-natured principle, called out the passions
and feelings of men at this extraordinary crisis.
It was the custom in the Navy not to pay punctually
the wages of the seamen, but to keep back
some part, lest the natural profuseness of that
wandering people should disperse them as often as
they were masters of a little sum. Grenville proposed
more frequent terms of payment. The superiors
of that class in the House of Commons, who,
according to the nature of mankind, liked that
others should endure what they had endured, and
who are apt to attribute their own proficience to
an education under which they had begun with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
suffering, had opposed this compassionate reformation;
and indeed the profession were but too well
founded in the advantages resulting from the established
hardships! Fox divided against the Bill,
though without speaking; and it was carried in that
House by above 60 to 42.</p>

<p>When it came to the Lords, it was warmly opposed
by Lord Winchelsea. The Duke of Bedford,
too honest to be always biassed by faction, supported
it against his friends, as he had the Militia Bill.
Lord Denbigh, a man whose parts were better than
his character, spoke out in very plain terms: he
said, he should be for measures, not men: good
measures he would support, whoever proposed them,
be his name William, Holles, or even <em>Harry</em>&mdash;and
observing all the Bishops withdrawn but two, he
supposed, he said, they were gone to dinner&mdash;he
hoped they would not return to vote! The Dukes
of Newcastle and Devonshire, Lord Hardwicke, and
many others had retired, which gave but too fair a
handle for that satire on the Bench. The Bill was
rejected by 23 to 18.</p>

<p>The <em>inter-ministerium</em> (if I may be permitted to
use a new word on a new occasion; and truly as
there never was such a being as the Duke of Newcastle,
one may be allowed to describe him, his
actions, and their consequences in a novel language,)
had now lasted seven weeks. On the last rupture
of the treaty with Pitt, his Grace thought he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
determined to take the sole burthen of the State
upon himself. He even sent his Majesty word that
he would be at Kensington on the 24th, and would
declare his final resolution&mdash;but he put the King
off; he had fixed on nothing&mdash;and while he prevented
any other man from having power, his own
idea of being Minister was in a manner answered.
Lord Lincoln, Lady Catherine Pelham, and Lord
Ashburnham, the private chorus, that had not the
less part in the drama for being cyphers, earnestly
dissuaded him from coming in again without an
union with Leicester House. To advise him to be
governed by his fears, was governing him. He
reverted to another interview with Pitt at Lord
Royston’s, where Lord Hardwicke was present.</p>

<p>Pitt, the more he foresaw incompliance on the
Duke’s part, knew how much more grace he should
wear (if forced to come to public explanation), by
stipulating some advantages to his country, asked if
they meant to send abroad any part of the new
granted million, as Lord Granville and Fox had
declared for doing. Newcastle said, he was not
bound by their declarations&mdash;“and you, Mr. Pitt,
you are not bound against sending any of it, are
you?” Pitt replied he was; “and you, my lord,
though you are not <em>bound</em> to send any more money
abroad, are not you inclined to it?” Newcastle
would not explain. Lord Hardwicke proposed to
wave this point <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad referendum</i>; knowing how easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
they should settle the nation’s concerns, if they
could agree upon their own. They then passed to
the article of Chancellor of the Exchequer. Pitt
urged that he had had it before for one of his
friends; Newcastle, that it would mark his having
no power at the Treasury. Neither would yield.
Even on the first Lord of the Admiralty, Newcastle
haggled, pretending the King would not be brought
to dismiss Lord Winchelsea.</p>

<p>They parted in discontent; though the Duke, in
all his messages by the Primate, Lord George Sackville,
and others, had promised how reasonable he
would be. This was exactly the manner in which
he had formerly treated Fox, departing from his
own concessions before he had time to ratify them.
Lord Hardwicke behaved more uniformly; declared
he would not take the Seals again; desired nobody
should be displaced for him; if the Presidentship of
the Council, or the Privy Seal should be vacant, he
would gladly accept either: for Lord Anson he
peremptorily insisted on the Treasurership of the
Navy. Pitt now found his error; by facilitating
Newcastle’s escape from the inquiries, he remained
at the mercy of that Duke, not the Duke at his.</p>

<p>May 27th.&mdash;The Duke of Newcastle did go to
Kensington, and after a long audience, promised to
be sole Minister, permitting Fox to be Paymaster,
but with no power. Sir Thomas Robinson was to
be Secretary of State, Sir George Lee, Chancellor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the Exchequer. Hume Campbell modestly asked
the Treasurership of the Navy<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> under this Ministry,
in addition to his office of Lord Register&mdash;and
probably would have had it, or something equivalent:
Newcastle’s greatest want now was of men who
would take anything to support him. Lord Egmont
was much solicited to be of the band; but he, the
great opposer of the Duke of Cumberland and Fox,
would have stipulated for more power to the latter,
and did insist on a Peerage for himself, which would
have destroyed his whole utility: it was not in the
placid House of Lords that Newcastle expected to
be worried. The Duke of Dorset was to be displaced
(for Lord George Sackville had been designed
for Pitt’s Secretary at War), Lord Gower was to be
Master of the Horse, and Lord Hardwicke Privy
Seal. The Duke of Newcastle was to retire to
Claremont for two or three days, and take a final
inspiration from his oracles.</p>

Army a regiment of Hussars and some light troops, in order
to cover the western side of Bohemia from the incursions of
the Prussians. The Empress Queen has communicated to
several of the Courts with whom she is in friendship, the
conditions that were proposed for bringing about a neutrality
in favour of the Electorate of Hanover. According to the
overtures made on this occasion, the King of Great Britain,
in quality of Elector of Hanover, would have been considered
as a party not concerned in the present war, in consequence
of which neither his troops nor those of his Allies were to
act against those of the Empress Queen and her Allies. He
would likewise have engaged not to assist the King of
Prussia either with troops or money. The passage through
that part of his Electorate which lies on the left of the Aller
was to have been granted to the troops of her Imperial
Majesty and her Allies, they paying for provisions, forage,
and waggons; besides which, they were to be allowed to
establish magazines and hospitals in such places as should be
assigned them in the Electorate. The town of Hamelen was
to be given up as a security, either into the hands of the
Empress or of some of her Allies, or to the guarantees of the
Convention, which were proposed to be the Empress of
Russia and the King of Denmark. Besides all this, it was
to be stipulated in this Convention, that the Hanoverian
troops should be quartered in such places only as should be
agreed upon, and their number not augmented. (<cite>Extract

<p>June 3rd.&mdash;His Grace returned to Kensington,
but still fluctuating; and begged to defer declaring
his last resolution till the Tuesday following: this
was on the Friday. Preposterous as this suspense
of Government was, it occasioned no disturbance,
scarce a murmur. The people, hating Fox, neglected
by Pitt, and despising Newcastle, waited with
patience to see which of them was to be their
master.</p>

<p>The next day was the Birthday of the Prince of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Wales. His Royal Highness was told, that it would
have a gracious air with the people, if he took upon
himself to facilitate measures for his grandfather’s
ease; that he must command Pitt to give up the
point of George Grenville being Chancellor of the
Exchequer. Pitt, who had heard how much he was
loaded by the other factions with the accusation of
impracticable haughtiness, yielded; and had a conference
at the Prince’s drawing-room with Newcastle
and Lord Bute, who acted as mediator. Newcastle
persisted that the King <em>would</em> retain Lord Winchelsea;
and to balance the authority that he saw
must fall to Pitt, said to him, “But you will not
act with Fox.”&mdash;Pitt replied, “My lord, I never
said so&mdash;but does your Grace say you would? When
you have said you will, I will consult my friends.”
Newcastle, not the most intelligible even when he
was explicit, took care not to be understood sooner
than he was determined; and the conversation
ended abruptly:&mdash;however, on the 7th, though not
agreed with Pitt, he went to Kensington, and declared
to the King, that he could not come in, unless
Mr. Pitt’s whole plan was accepted. The King
reproached him bitterly with all his shifts and
evasions, and falsehoods; and demanded his assistance
for Fox, if he would not himself undertake the
service. He waved any such promise, and the
King dismissed him in wrath.</p>

<p>Fox now took the merit of venturing all to support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
his Majesty, and declared he would accept the
Ministry&mdash;but it seemed almost impossible to form
one, if Pitt was not to be of it, and Newcastle withheld
his assistance. It was difficult even to know
whom they should place at the head of the Treasury.
In this distress the King (probably by the suggestion
of Mr. Fox,) sent for Lord Waldegrave, and commanded
him to accept that high and dangerous post.
The public was not more astonished at that designation,
than the Earl himself. Though no man
knew the secrets of Government better, no man
knew the manœuvre of business less. He was no
speaker in Parliament, had no interest there, and
though universally beloved and respected where
known, was by no means familiarized to the eyes of
the nation. He declined as long as modesty became
him; engaged with spirit, the moment he felt the
abandoned state in which his master and benefactor
stood.</p>

<p>A trifling incident showed the ridiculous light in
which the new establishment appeared: it was the
8th of June when Fox’s Administration was notified:
the House of Commons was very thin; Ellis came
with an air of mysterious importance, and desired
the House to adjourn to the 13th following. Lord
George Sackville and George Townshend opposed
this in joke, the latter saying that a Bill of great
consequence relating to Milbourn-port was to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
considered that day; yet if Ellis would say that a
Ministry was to be formed during the proposed
recess, he would consent to it. Ellis would say
nothing; the House divided, Ellis with ten more
against fifty-seven; and thus Fox lost a question
even before he was Minister.</p>

<p>The next day Lord Holderness went to Kensington
and resigned the Seals, as a declaration of the
Newcastle squadron against Fox. The King received
him with the cool scorn he deserved.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Lord
Rockingham and many others<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> notified their intention
of resigning upon the same foot. Newcastle
took pains to promote these resignations, and told
Lord Northumberland that they caught like wildfire.
The latter replied artfully, “I have great obligations
to your Grace, but should think I repaid them very
ill by resigning, as it would be contributing to make
your Grace distress his Majesty.” Indeed, to the
King and others, the Duke solemnly forswore any
knowledge of that measure; and while he enjoined
or inculcated it to his friends, he prohibited it to
Lord Lincoln and the Duke of Leeds, his relations,
that he might tell the King that his own family had
stood by his Majesty&mdash;a silly finesse, and blown up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>even by himself, he bragging to Lord Waldegrave
of the display of his power in that measure, the very
instant after he had denied it with oaths.</p>

<p>One resignation was made on the other hand;
Sir George Lee quitted the Princess, not brooking
the influence of Pitt with her, and finding himself a
cypher at that Court, since Lord Bute had become
more than Minister there. Sir George had even
once determined to make such a remonstrance to her
on her conduct, as the Fathers of the Church had
formerly assumed the impertinent familiarity of
making to Princes, in ages when insolence was
reckoned a primitive virtue.</p>

<p>Horace Walpole saw the precipice on which Fox
stood, and wished to save him from it. He saw,
too, an opening for delivering the nation from that
disgraceful man (Newcastle), who had so long perplexed
all its Councils, and been a principal cause
of its misfortunes. He sounded Lord George Sackville,
and thinking him not ill-disposed to Fox, and
by no means amicable to Newcastle, he proposed his
plan to the former. It was, that the King should
send <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte blanche</i> to Pitt, to place the Duke of
Dorset at the head of the Treasury, with Lord
George for Secretary at War, and, by dissolving
the Parliament, dissipate at once Newcastle’s influence.
Fox, who feared a popular election, disapproved
the latter part, and did not relish Lord
George in the War Office&mdash;too sharp-sighted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
who, to the desertion of Fox, had added a refusal of
making Calcraft agent to his regiment. However,
he permitted Walpole to propose all this to Lord
George, adding that he would take Paymaster (which
seemed to be his nearest wish), under Pitt, or would
even act under him without an employment, with
the sole privilege reserved of abusing Newcastle as
much as he pleased.</p>

<p>Lord George Sackville owned he should have
liked the plan, but was now too far engaged. He
confessed he had taken his part, as the contest lay
between Leicester House and the Duke; and the
rather, as he had long observed that the Duke loved
none but men totally detached from all other connexions,
and had even been less kind to Conway
since his marriage; and, as an insurmountable
objection, said, that Lord Bute, who was of scrupulous
honour, would now reckon their party bound
by these resignations. Thus this plan failed, though
the King, whose aversion was diverted from Pitt to
Newcastle, would have consented to anything, that
might make the treacheries of the latter fall on his
own head.</p>

<p>Fox’s junto met two or three times: Lord Granville
would have infused his jovial intrepidity into
them: Bedford wanted no inspired ardour; but
Fox himself desponded, and Bedford reproached
him with it.</p>

<p>June 11th.&mdash;Lord Mansfield went to Kensington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
with the Exchequer Seals, which Fox was to receive.
The King asked the former his opinion;
Lord Mansfield told him fairly it could not do for
Fox; then, said the King, “Let them make an
Administration.” Fox and Lord Waldegrave both
told him the impossibilities they found, yet would
proceed if his Majesty insisted. He said, “No, he
did not desire his friends should suffer for him: he
found he was to be prisoner for the rest of his life:
he hoped, whatever he might be made to do, his
friends would not impute to him, for he should not
be a free agent: he had not thought that he had so
many of Newcastle’s <em>footmen</em><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> about him: soon, he
supposed, he should not be able to make a Page of
the Back-stairs. For Hanover, he must give it up, it
cost an hundred and twenty thousand pounds a month
for forage alone: he found he must lose his Electoral
dominions for an English quarrel: while at the
same time he lost all authority in England!”</p>

<p>Leicester House took advantage of these difficulties:
they engaged Lord Chesterfield to negotiate
between Newcastle and Pitt. The Earl, who
had lived for some time retired from business, undertook
the Embassy. It seemed a marvellous
office for him, who had long broken with the latter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and had even, in very cutting terms, acquainted
the world with his reasons for breaking with the
former. But it seems he had still stronger prejudices
to the Duke of Cumberland: he undertook
the employ<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> with cheerfulness and success.</p>

<p>On the 15th, the King wrote a note to Lord
Hardwicke, desiring him, in consideration of the
state of affairs both at home and abroad, to hasten
some Administration that might not be changed
again in five months. He mentioned his promise
of the Pay-Office to Fox, and his obligations to
Lord Winchelsea. Lord Hardwicke promised to
wait on his Majesty on the 17th with some plan;
but the next day desired a day longer.</p>

<p>At last, after an interval of above eleven weeks,
the Ministry was settled, and kissed hands on the
29th. The Duke of Newcastle returned to the
Treasury, with Legge for his Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Pitt and Lord Holderness were Secretaries
of State. Lord Temple had the Privy Seal
in the room of Lord Gower, who was made Master
of the Horse, the Duke of Dorset being set aside,
but with a pension of 3000<em>l.</em> a-year, added to his
Wardenship of the Cinque Ports. On Lord George
Sackville the King put a flat negative. Fox accepted
the Pay-Office, professing great content, and
that he should offend neither in thought, word, nor
deed. Both Newcastle and Pitt acted wisely in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
permitting him to enjoy this place: he was tied up
from giving them any trouble&mdash;and while serving
for interest under Pitt, how much did it exalt the
latter! Yet the latter, too, took care to deserve his
share of reproach.</p>

<p>Adjusting their list with Lord Hardwicke, Pitt
said, he missed a very respectable name there,
which he hoped would be placed greatly&mdash;it was
Lord Anson’s&mdash;and he was restored to the Admiralty&mdash;whether
with more opprobrium to himself,
who returned to that Board with Pitt’s set, abandoning
his own, who had been disgraced with him;
or to Pitt, who restored so incapable an object to a
trust so wretchedly executed, I am in doubt to determine.
Who did act with honour and noble
spirit, was Lord Winchelsea; he refused a pension,
disdaining to accept any emolument, when his associates
were excluded. At that Board he always
acted with capacity, everywhere with firmness; and
was the only man who, in all these changes, acquired
credit, both by his rise and by his fall.</p>

<p>Lord Cholmondeley got a pension to make way
for Potter: Lord Thomond had Lord Bateman’s
White Stick, who, the Duke of Newcastle said arrogantly
enough, should not carry his messages. Tennison
was removed with a pension from the Buck-Hounds,
ceding them to Lord Bateman. Pitt
insisted that Pratt, a favourite lawyer at the bar
of the House of Commons, should be Attorney-General.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Sir Robert Henley, who could not decently
be disgraced without any reason, was so
lucky to find that that reason (and certainly there
could be no other) was sufficient to promote him:
he was made Lord Keeper. The Seals had been
offered to Murray, and to the Master of the Rolls,
who refused them, and to Willes, who proposed to
be bribed by a Peerage, to be at the head of his
profession, but could not obtain it. Henley, however,
who saw it was the mode of the times to be
paid by one favour for receiving another, demanded
a Tellership of the Exchequer for his son, which
was granted, with a pension of 1500<em>l.</em> a-year till it
should drop; and, as if heaping rewards on him
would disguise his slender pretensions, Lord Hardwicke
told him he must be Speaker of the House of
Lords too, for Westminster-Hall would never forgive
him (Lord Hardwicke) if he suffered those
offices to be disjoined. Sandys and his son were
both laid aside. Hardwicke himself took no employment;
the Seals, which it was plain from his
not resuming them, he had not resigned from mere
friendship to Newcastle, were too great a fatigue;
and no other of the great offices was vacant.</p>

<p>It was no small mischief flowing from these disgraceful
revolutions, the additional charge entailed
on the public. Here were new pensions, of 3000<em>l.</em>
a-year to Dorset, near as much to Cholmondeley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
1500<em>l.</em> to Henley, 1200<em>l.</em> to Tennison; besides
others more secret. Yet all this profusion of grants
and concessions could not satisfy everybody. The
Townshends were furious: George, at any amnesty
for Fox; Charles, at not being promoted himself. Lord
Halifax, who demanded to be Secretary of State for
the West Indies, a theatre on which Pitt meditated
to shine himself, threw up on being refused; but,
having outlived his income, was forced to re-accept,
what, unless he had persisted, he had done more
wisely to retain. The Duke of Bedford was warm
against the new system, but was soon composed.
The City, too, was indignant at the re-establishment
of Lord Anson: but when the chiefs are accorded,
the mob of a faction are little regarded. Men
could not but smile observing Pitt return to Court,
the moment he had been made free of so many
cities for quitting it, exactly as he accepted an employment
there before old Marlborough was scarce
cold, who had left him 10,000<em>l.</em> as a reward for his
patriotism.</p>

<p>The King gave the Garter to Lord Waldegrave,
an almost unprecedented favour, as it was given
alone&mdash;but he deserved it&mdash;and this act of royalty,
almost the only flower of the Crown unviolated,
gave the King double satisfaction, for he had before
given hopes of it to Lord Holderness, who being,
like Lord Harrington, the mere creature of his
Majesty’s bounty, had, like Lord Harrington, been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the first to insult his master with an offensive resignation.</p>

<p>I here close the scene on these Court squabbles;
and perhaps have described them too minutely.
Passages, in which one has been conversant, often
appear too interesting. I can only say, that I have
preferred offending in this extreme to the contrary.
Nothing is more easy than to pass over what is too
diffuse&mdash;but, as many men love these details, their
curiosity would be unsatisfied with abridgments.
Probably these anecdotes will amuse for some years,
till they are lost in the mass of books, and when
the affairs of this little spot, which we call Britain,
shall appear of no more importance than our island
itself in a geographic picture. To be read for a
few years is immortality enough for such a writer
as me!</p>

<p>A greater field was now opened. That formidable
confederacy of France, Austria, Russia, and Sweden,
seemed determined to enclose and crush the King of
Prussia. The Duke of Cumberland, with the forlorn
Hanoverian army, was a slight barrier against
such alarming advances. Coloredo, the Austrian
Minister at London, was ordered to retire without
taking leave; and as a further earnest of their
hostile intentions to England, Ostend and Nieuport
were resigned into the hands of France. Count
Daun, the Austrian Fabius, was sent with 45,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
men to raise the siege of Prague. The King of
Prussia, too impetuous to await their cautious approach,
flew with about 30,000 men to meet them;
and finding Daun strongly entrenched on a hill,
thought ardour and his name sufficient to dislodge
them. He returned seven times to the attack after
as many repulses, performed actions of extravagant
bravery himself; and when forced at last, by an
impregnable situation, by superior numbers, and
by equal valour, to abandon his purpose, he crowned
the splendour of the enterprise by modestly confessing
how unadvisedly he had undertaken it. He
raised the siege of Prague, and retired to Leutmeritz.
Daun had the good sense to know that his
country was not to be saved by the rules of romance.
Rashness might immortalize a Monarch whose crown
and life were at stake, and were at the same time
less objects than his glory: a subject would be unpardonable,
and of all subjects an Austrian had the
least chance of pardon, who should suffer his fame
to weigh one moment against his duty.</p>

<p>The French in the meantime advanced in such
formidable numbers, that the Duke of Cumberland
was obliged to retire and leave Hanover at their
mercy. However, they came up with him at
Hastenbecke, and a battle ensued. The Duke never
showed himself so able a General, and though exceedingly
inferior in force, disputed his ground till
the French, who had great difficulty to carry up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
their men to the charge, despaired of the victory.
But fresh squadrons pouring in upon him, and more
approaching, his Royal Highness, apprehensive of
being enclosed, resigned the success, though not the
glory, of the day to D’Etrées, who was happy to
find his enemy take a step that he was deliberating
whether it would not be prudent for him to take
himself. The Hanoverian statesmen, in the wildness
of their despair for the destruction of their
country and of their fortunes, not caring whom they
charged, accused <em>that</em> Prince of timidity, whom all
England had all his life accused of rash and German
appetite for fighting; and the French with no less
injustice decried their own victorious General, till
Madame Pompadour and the Courtiers took advantage
to supplant him; and Richelieu was sent to
become those laurels which had been earned by the
best officer in their service.</p>

<p>The King almost sunk under this weight of misfortunes.
That country, which with so much patriotism
and so little prudence he had made the
point in which his whole policy centred&mdash;that
country now felt all the bitterness of desolation!
Hanover, which so long had tasted the felicity of
being conjoined to England, was now ravaged in
an English quarrel. And unless we will suppose
that his Majesty hoped to hire out his Electoral
troops to his Crown in a contest which he flattered
himself would never be agitated in Germany,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
one cannot conceive why with such improvident
facility he had permitted the Chancellor and Newcastle
to bound into a war with France; a war
undertaken from some provocation, with no preparation;
and discussed with no more solidity, than
the mob, whom it was made to captivate, could have
employed. The French had aimed at and proceeded
to invade our settlements. We returned hostilities
with as slight a force as if we had only sent a herald
to denounce war. We then seized their ships&mdash;and
did nothing more; yes, we engaged some German
mercenaries, as if the Duke of Newcastle had
thought that the Rhine and the Ohio were the same
river. Had we, like the French, waved expressions
of war, till we had mustered a mighty force in America,
where our superiority is exceedingly great;
had we increased our Navy before we seized theirs;
had we at least imitated their arts as well as their
invasions, we might have dictated in the new world,
and lived without hostilities in the old. No wonder
the King was overwhelmed with the explosion
of such calamities and blunders&mdash;still he had deserved
compassion; had he not shown that, whatever
his reflection suggested, his heart had no generous
feelings&mdash;But of this anon.</p>

<p>The Court at Leicester House was very differently
employed during these serious transactions. Hanover
was lost; in North America our affairs went ill;
England itself was in no flourishing condition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
How did the Princess occupy the heir of all these
domains? She was not Spartan enough to buckle
on his armour with her own hands, and send him
to save or reconquer what he was to govern. The
light of the Gospel has emancipated mothers from
such robust sensations. The Prince was instructed
to commit the care of the temporal concerns of his
subjects to Providence; and therefore, instead of
sending men, arms, ammunition to the invaded
frontiers of our colonies,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> with more patriarchal
vigilance his Royal Highness sent them an hundred
pounds’ worth of Leland’s polemic writings against
the Deists. The Princess herself bestowed an annuity
of one hundred pounds on a young Scotch<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
clergyman, who having been persecuted by the kirk
for writing a tragedy called Douglas, threw himself
and his piece on the protection of the Earl of Bute.</p>

<p>I have said our affairs in North America went
ill; it is very true. About this time came letters
from the Earl of Loudun, the Commander-in-Chief
there, who said, he found the French were 21,000
strong; he had not so many; could not attack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>Louisbourg; should return to Halifax. Admiral
Holbourn, one of the sternest condemners of Byng,
wrote at the same time, that he having but seventeen
ships, and the French nineteen, he dared not
attack them. These disappointments gave great
disgust. Lord Loudun had been selected by the
Duke and Fox for this command, and our expectations
had been raised high of what he would perform.
Here was another summer lost! Pitt expressed
himself with great vehemence against the Earl&mdash;and
we naturally have too lofty ideas of our naval
strength to suppose that seventeen of our ships are
not a match for any nineteen others.</p>

<p>At home there were great disturbances on the
new Militia Bill. Lord Hardwicke and the Lords,
meaning to defeat it, had clogged it with impracticabilities,
absurdities, and hardships; particularly
by obliging every poor man to pay ten pounds, or
find a substitute, or go for a soldier; and yet he
would be liable to serve again at the end of three
years. This was a tax of above three pounds a
year. Nor was any fund provided for the expenses
of carrying the Act into execution. These objections
gave sufficient handle to the disaffected to
decry the system. The Tory gentlemen in particular,
apprehending that the Whigs would acquire
influence in their counties by the articles of clothing,
&amp;c., used their utmost endeavours to prepossess
the country against the Bill. They inculcated into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the people a belief that they would be trepanned to
Gibraltar, like the two Somersetshire regiments that
I formerly mentioned; and that whoever should
give in his name, would to all intents and purposes
become a soldier for life.</p>

<p>This misrepresentation had too fatal effect. The
peasants became refractory beyond measure; riots
were raised in several counties, as Surrey, Kent,
Leicester, Hertford, Bedford, Nottingham, and
York shires. The lists were forced by violence
from the magistrates; Lord Robert Sutton was in
danger of his life at Nottingham; the Duke of Bedford’s
house, near Bedford, was threatened to be
demolished, as he had been the first to advertise for
a meeting. The Blues were ordered down to his
defence; and it was worth observation, that the
standing Army was employed to impose upon the
people a constitutional force. His Grace threatened
to carry the act into execution with a high hand,
but on the day of the meeting he adjourned it to
December, when he knew he should be in Ireland.
The Duke of Dorset was attacked at Knowle, but
saved by a young officer, who sallied out, and seized
two-and-twenty of the rioters. The Speaker himself
was insulted at Guildford, and menaced in his
own house at Ember-court, and could not disperse
the insurrection but by promising no further steps
should be taken till the next session of Parliament.
But the greatest indecencies were committed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
family of Townshend. George, the author of the
Militia, was on very ill terms with his father, who
was as wrong-headed as his son, and more mad.
They wrote abusive pamphlets against one another;
and the father, attended by a parson and a few low
people, began a mob on the day the meeting for the
Militia was to be held, and pasted up one of his
own libels on the doors of four churches nearest to
his seat.</p>

<p>Under these difficulties, Mr. Pitt began to exert
his new-acquired power, and to give symptoms of
more vigorous government. France, notwithstanding
her imposing airs, and our feeble and spiritless
conduct, had carried no great point against us.
Her finances were in disorder, her marine not respectable,
the flower of her armies transported to
Germany. Their King threw a damp on all operations.
Melancholic, apprehensive of assassination,
desirous of resigning his Crown, averse to the war
from principles of humanity, perplexed by factions,
and still resigned to the influence of his mistress,
every measure was confirmed by him with reluctance
or obtained by intrigues; yet they had imprinted
such terrors of invasion upon us, that Mr.
Pitt, concluding their own coasts might be ill-provided,
while they menaced ours, determined to strike
a hardy stroke, that should at once invert the system
of fear, and restore our reputation by carrying the
war into the quarters of the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a young Scot, by name Clarke, ill-favoured
in his person, with a cast in his eyes, of
intellects not very sound, but quick, bold, adventurous.
At the siege of Berg-op-zoom, being pursued
into a house where the enemies fired at him
through a door, he opened it and told them he was
related to Marshal Lowendahl, who would reward
them for saving him. Being conducted to the Marshal,
with the same readiness he avowed the deceit,
urging that he had no other method of saving his
life. Lowendahl was pleased with the man, and
gave him money. Not rising in England to his
expectation, he attempted to advance himself in
Ireland under the Duke of Devonshire; where miscarrying
too, he imputed his disappointment to Mr.
Conway, who equally incapable of disserving any
man, or of enduring a false imputation, took Clarke
to task, and convinced him of his error. Clarke,
in the interval of some of these adventures, had
rambled into France, and passing through Rochfort,
observed a bank to which there was no ditch, and
one part of the fortification left quite open. The
adjacent country, called Little Holland, was flat,
and cut with dykes, but which he persuaded himself
were easily passable. Four years had passed since
he made these remarks, and that in a time of profound
peace. He did not pretend to know the
strength of the garrison, nor what troops were stationed
on the coast since the declaration of war&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
unfortunately a plan of the place procured by
the late Lord Albemarle from the King’s closet,
since Clarke’s survey, differed from his description.
Yet communicating these observations to Mr. Pitt,
the latter was captivated with the idea. The man
and the project struck his notions of performing
some action of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</i>, that might revive our sinking
affairs, and throw a lustre on the dawn of his own
Administration.</p>

<p>Rochfort lies ten miles from the sea. Of late
years, we had dealt exceeding scantily in intelligence.
No measures were, possibly could not in
time be, taken to obtain better information of the
dispositions in and near the place. Pitt indeed was
a Minister to execute daringly; there wanted some
men of deeper cast to deliberate wisely. He would
not lose time on taking advice; the secret might
evaporate; and its fairest chance for success lay in
the improbability that the French should suspect an
attempt on one of the most important and strongest
towns in France. But did not that very improbability
intimate, that they, so provident about their
frontier towns, could not have neglected Rochfort,
one of their principal naval magazines? Objections
to a genius are but spurs. The Cabinet Council
was called. Pitt proposed his conception of surprising
Rochfort, and of burning the ships that lay
in the river leading to it. The procrastinators in
the Cabinet had but too lately felt his fire, to oppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
what they saw was a favourite plan. It was determined
to be executed forthwith; and the execution
offered to Lord George Sackville, who, too sagacious
not to feel the impracticability, excused himself,
pleading the averseness of the Duke to him, and
therefore that he should not be supported. The
excuse was flimsy. The persons who offered him
the command, would have supported him the more
for his disfavour with the Duke. Lord George was
still more blameable in talking of the design to
several persons after he had refused to undertake it;
and yet though a large number were acquainted
with it, the secret was kept from the public with
uncommon fidelity.</p>

<p>Sir John Mordaunt and General Conway, then
encamped in Dorsetshire, were summoned to town,
and acquainted by the Cabinet Council with the
service on which they were to be sent. They
should take ten old battalions, a strong Fleet should
be ready in a fortnight to convoy them; they were
to attempt Rochfort, or any other place on the coast
to which they should find an opening. The Generals
felt the difficulty of the commission, saw the
crowd of impediments that must arise, and the
ignorance of those that foresaw none. Conway, as
he told me himself, was satisfied he had given such
indisputable proofs of his courage, that it could not
be imputed to fear, if he discovered repugnance to
the service&mdash;whatever might be imputed to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
he was determined honestly to speak his opinion.
He asked if they would venture ten of our best battalions
on so rash a hazard? If they should perish,
would it not draw the French hither, where we had
few other veteran troops? He asked, on being told
the ramparts were to be scaled, if their height was
known? Ligonier, who was present, replied, No;
but they never were above twenty-five feet; and
they should have ladders high enough. Pitt said,
in case they failed, they might go to Bourdeaux.
Lord Anson informed him how far that city lay up
the river&mdash;and it <em>was</em> information, for he knew not.
Was it probable, Conway asked, that a place of that
high importance should be neglected? and he showed
them the contradictions in their own reasoning, for
they pretended that it was a measure calculated to
disembarrass the Duke, by drawing off the troops
of France to its own coast, and yet all the hope of
the enterprise depended on the French being taken
unprepared. Pitt was too sanguine to desist for a
little confutation. The instructions were drawn,
the transports prepared.</p>

<p>At first, Conway had been designed to command
alone, but the King said he was too young, and
insisted on joining Mordaunt with him. Mordaunt
had been remarkable for alertness and bravery, but
was much broken both in spirit and constitution,
and fallen into a nervous disorder, which had made
him entreat last year not to be sent to America,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
lest it should affect his head, and bring on disorders
too familiar to his family. But though he and
Conway had ill conceit of the service in question,
they had both too much honour to decline it. When
their representations failed, all they could was to
demand specific orders; and not obtaining them,
they drew up queries, which if the Ministry could
not answer, the Generals hoped they should be justified
in not performing what they foresaw impracticable.
But neither in this did they receive satisfaction.</p>

<p>The measure was settled in July; but it was the
8th of September before the Fleet sailed. The
French, though they did not learn the specific spot
of destination, had ample time for preparation; and
having a chain of garrisons along the coast, and
being never totally destitute of supernumerary
troops, hoped to be able to draw together a sufficient
body wherever the storm should fall. As the
event occasioned much discourse, I shall be excusable
for detailing it; yet I shall do it with brevity; and,
as much proceeded from the personal characters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the commanders, I shall describe them shortly, and
with the more satisfaction, as their faults flowed
from no want of courage; on the contrary, they
possessed amongst them most of the various shades
of that qualification. Mordaunt, as I have said,
had a sort of alacrity in daring, but from ill health
was grown more indifferent to it. He affected not
Mr. Pitt, and from not loving the projector, was
more careless than he should have been of the success
of the project, presuming, unfortunately for
himself, that if it should appear impracticable, the
original mover would bear the blame.</p>

<p>Conway, secure of his own intrepidity, and of no
ostentation, could not help foreseeing that from the
superiority of his talents to those of Mordaunt, the
good conduct of the expedition would be expected
from him. The more answerable he thought himself,
the more he guarded against objections. Cold in his
deportment, and with a dignity of soul that kept him
too much above familiarity, he missed that affection
from his brother officers, which his unsullied virtues
and humanity deserved; for he wanted the extrinsic
of merit. Added to these little failings, he had a
natural indecision in his temper, weighing with too
much minuteness and too much fluctuation whatever
depended on his own judgment. Cornwallis was a
man of a very different complexion: as cool as Conway,
and as brave, he was indifferent to everything
but to being in the right. He held fame cheap,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and smiled at reproach. General Howard was one
of those sort of characters who are only to be distinguished
by having no peculiarity of character.
Under these was Wolfe, a young officer who had
contracted reputation from his intelligence of discipline,
and from the perfection to which he had
brought his own regiment. The world could not
expect more from him than he thought himself
capable of performing. He looked on danger as
the favourable moment that would call forth his
talents.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Hawke commanded the fleet&mdash;a man
of steady courage, of fair appearance, and who even
did not want a plausible kind of sense; but he was
really weak, and childishly abandoned to the guidance
of a Scotch secretary. The next was Knowles, a
vain man, of more parade than real bravery. Howe,
brother of the Lord of that name, was the third on
the naval list. He was undaunted as a rock, and
as silent; the characteristics of his whole race. He
and Wolfe soon contracted a friendship like the
union of a cannon and gunpowder.</p>

<p>September 20th.&mdash;The Fleet appeared off the
isle of Oleron; but it was the 23rd before they got
in. Knowles, the Vice-Admiral, with his division,
was ordered to attack the little isle of Aix. Howe,
who led this detachment, sailed up with a steady
magnanimity without firing till within pistol-shot
of the fort. Greaves followed, and Keppel pressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
forward to get in between them: Knowles kept a
little more distant. Howe began a dreadful fire,
and in less than two hours the garrison surrendered.
Conway pressed them to proceed immediately on some
further enterprise, and proposed directly to go and
consult Sir Edward Hawke, who lay more out at
sea. Knowles replied, that he was so fatigued that
he could not go till next morning; when he reposed
himself till ten. When Conway got him to Sir
Edward Hawke’s ship, they found Sir Edward had
sent Broderick with their only pilot to see where they
could land&mdash;and these men did not return till noon.
Mordaunt appeared incapable of forming any opinion,
and said he was ready to take any officer’s advice.</p>

<p>In this dilemma they called a Council of War.
In their deliberation, it appeared that Clarke, and
Thierri, a French Pilot, had not seen Rochfort in
three years and half: it was longer since the latter
was there: that the nature of the road of Basques,
the country, the state of the troops and garrison,
were entirely unknown to them: that the expedition
had been projected on the sole footing of a surprise,
a view now entirely vanished, for our troops
had lain near two months in the Isle of Wight, and
many letters and neutral vessels had been intercepted,
which spoke the alarm spread along the coast:
that no man of war could lie within two miles of
the landing to assist that or secure a retreat; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
that if the wind came to the west, as was usual at
that season, all communication with the Fleet would
be cut off; a point recommended to them to guard
against by the express instructions of Marshal
Ligonier: that there were sand-hills on the shore
equivalent to an entrenchment, from behind which
a small body of men might prevent a descent of
2000 men, the most the boats could contain at a
time; and that even more troops than were sufficient
for that purpose had been seen by the captains who
went to sound and reconnoitre the coast: and what
was even more discouraging than all these impediments,
the chief engineer declared that they had
not brought artillery sufficient for a regular attack.</p>

<p>As to Rochfort, many difficulties were foreseen
from the state of the place; and considering how
long the fleet had lain off the coast, it was highly
probable that not only the approach was guarded
in a manner to have our troops cut to pieces, as they
must have landed in small divisions; but that a
strong garrison must have been thrown into the
place, if not provided with one before. Bonville,
a French volunteer, declared there were sluices with
which they could flow the place all round; and he
and the pilot of the Neptune had seen the ditch full
of water. The dock-men were numerous, and five
ships lay in the river, whose crews amounted to
near 3000 men; besides the Militia of the country.
We should have been two days marching to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
place, and could have carried up to it but 7400
men. The nights were as light as day; and a letter
found in a Priest’s house at Aix, dated from Rochfort
on the 18th, spoke expressly of the precautions
the Governor had taken.</p>

<p>No reasonable man could hope to surmount all
these difficulties. Those, who had carried the same
opinion from home with them, were not likely to
find the objections weaker when mustered together
on the spot. Both land and sea concurred in voting
the surprisal of Rochfort impracticable, and then
would have returned to England; but Conway, who
the evening before had proposed to make themselves
masters of Fouras, a little fort on the shore, where,
when once established, they might examine what
further damage could be done to the enemy, persuaded
the Council that it was necessary to do
something before they retired. To that they all
agreed except Cornwallis, who had seen no attainable
object, or none worth attaining, from the beginning
to the end of the plan. Yet, that he might
not stand single in a vote for retreating, he
was induced to acquiesce:&mdash;however, Sir Edward
Hawke’s secretary, who took the minutes of the
deliberation, inserted Cornwallis’s real opinion into
their votes, and without reading them to the Council,
sent them to the English Admiralty, by whom
they were shown to the King; and what Cornwallis’s
associates had advised him to depart from, lest it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
might turn to his prejudice, was, after their return,
construed into the only sensible opinion.</p>

<p>Conway renewed his proposal of an attack on
Fouras, as, when once entrenched there, they might
with more preparation march to Rochfort; or at
least from thence hope to burn the five ships and
the magazines on the Charente. Nobody approved
the scheme. In these discussions three or four days
were wasted. Conway perpetually pressed for some
action&mdash;at last Mordaunt said carelessly, “Ay, let
us go stretch our legs on the Isle of Oleron.” Conway
said, a feigned diversion towards the Isle of
Rhée would be more advisable; it would draw the
French troops, who by this time must be alarmed, to
that side; and then some surprise might be practicable.
To this the rest would not agree. Conway
then offered to make a real attack on the Isle
of Oleron: they disputed on it till two in the morning;
and though the first proposal had come from
the others, he could not obtain their acquiescence.
They wasted time even in dining; Sir Edward
Hawke’s table lasted till late in the evening. Conway’s<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
importunity at last prevailed for an attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
on Fouras; and all the Generals, to show that want
of spirit had not operated in their Councils, resolved
to be present. The first division embarked, but
being moonlight, and the nights clear, and the wind
turning against them, Howe himself told them it
was not safe at that time; and Wolfe pronounced
it would be bloody work. They were ordered back
from their boats. Yet Conway persisting for an
attempt on Fouras, Mordaunt offered to undertake
it, if Conway would take the advice solely on himself.
Conway, eager for the danger, was averse to
being the author of it. Mordaunt then artfully
desired him to relinquish proposing it. Neither to
that would he yield. Mordaunt solicited him with
strange earnestness, either to abandon the project,
or to undertake it as his own; Mordaunt offering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
to share the danger of the execution, not of the
opinion. Conway at last said, if Mordaunt would
call Wolfe and any other man, and they would
advise him to advise the attack he would; or if they
advised him to desist from proposing it, he would;
but either Mordaunt declined&mdash;in truth, it was a
contest to be pitied rather than blamed: both saw
the rashness of the project, to which they were
willing to sacrifice themselves and their soldiers.
Mordaunt, from esteem of Conway’s abilities, hoped
to be excused if he executed what the latter advised&mdash;and
the latter was too happy in not being commanding
officer, to take that charge upon himself
in a hopeless bravado. Conway then proposed to
submit to the same alternative from the opinions of
Cornwallis and Howard; to which the General
acquiesced; and they, as he foresaw, concurring with
him, Conway submitted, but desired they would
observe, he acquiesced against his opinion&mdash;and it
was determined to return, Sir Edward Hawke
having often pressed the Generals to come to some
resolution, the bad season approaching so near that he
could not venture to keep the great ships much longer
at sea. Wolfe and Howe had borne the dilatoriness
of the chief commanders with indignation; yet seeing
the minute lost, made no objection to a retreat;
and the Fleet arrived at Portsmouth October 3rd&mdash;in
the meantime, many important events had happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>In the East Indies, the fleet under Admiral Watson
retrieved the damages inflicted on our settlements
by a new Nabob, of which we had received
notice in the preceding June. That Viceroy had
seized Cossimbuzar and Calcutta; the cruelties exercised
on the factory in the latter place, where 170
persons were crammed into a dungeon, and stifled
in the most shocking torments of heat, will not
bear to be described to a good-natured reader.
Watson was seconded by Captain Clive, one of those
extraordinary men, whose great soul broke out
under all the disadvantages of an ugly and contemptible
person.</p>

<p>In the north of Germany, affairs had taken a
favourable turn for the King of Prussia. Lehwald,
one of his Generals, defeated a mighty army of
Russians, who, in the most barbarian style, were
pouring into Prussia. The Germans, whatever they
pretended, were not cheaply conquerors. But the
consequences of the battle were decisive; the Muscovites
disappeared from the campaign for the rest
of the summer.</p>

<p>The Duke of Cumberland, after the battle of
Hastenbecke, had retired with his army towards
Stade, and was followed by the French. The
Duchies of Bremen and Verden were at the eve of
falling into their hands, and the King expected that
they would be given back to Sweden. The Hanoverian
Ministry did not doubt but the Duke’s high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
spirit would venture the Army being cut to pieces
rather than surrender them prisoners, and they
complained of the scanty assistance afforded by
England. Lady Yarmouth even said to Lord
Hertford, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Que peut on faire, my Lord! le
Ministere Anglois ne nous a voulu donner que
quelque tonneaux de farine</i>.” The truth was, the
King, to avoid expense, had neglected to raise the
Militia of Hanover, though they had implored it,
and might have given a decisive turn to the battle
in his favour. Both the Sovereign and his German
Council were determined at all events to save the
Duchies and the troops, and the most positive orders
were dispatched to the Duke in consequence of those
resolutions. Yet, not trusting to what conditions
his son, however obedient, might obtain, his Majesty
prevailed on his son-in-law, the King of Denmark,
to interpose his good offices, and accordingly, on
the 7th of September, Count Lynar, Governor of
Oldenburg, arrived in the Duke’s camp as mediator,
and a passport being demanded for him from Marshal
Richelieu, the latter sent it with an escort of a
hundred horse, and by the next day a convention
was obtained and signed, by which Stade and the
district round it was left to the Hanoverians, with
permission to the rest of those troops to repass the
Elbe, observing a strict neutrality. The troops of
Hesse, Brunswick, Saxe-Gotha, &amp;c., in the King’s
pay, were to retire to their several countries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>When the news of this suspension of arms arrived
at Kensington, it occasioned the greatest surprise,
the greatest clamour&mdash;for even the Monarch acted
surprise! The Foreign Ministers acquainted those
of England that it was concluded, or certainly
would be. The English with great truth disavowed
all knowledge, and protested entire disbelief of it.
They not only had not been entrusted with the
secret, but saw their master affect equal indignation,
and encouraged by that dissimulation, ventured to
insist on his permitting them to write to foreign
Courts that he disavowed the transaction. Even
this he granted. He went further: he told Dabreu,
the Spanish Minister, that he would show him the
rough draft of a letter which he had prepared to
send to his son, with a positive command to fight.
It was true, he had written such a letter; it is no
less true that he never sent it.</p>

<p>As the Dictator of the Convention disavowed it,
as the father disclaimed the son, it was natural for
those who suffered by the act, and for those who
hated the actor, to break out against both. The
King of Prussia said we had undone him, without
mending our own situation. The Princess of Wales,
Lord Hardwicke, and Legge threw the strongest
reflections on the Duke; the last, indeed, with appearance
of reason, being extremely hampered, as
Chancellor of the Exchequer, by this transaction.
How should he be able, he said, next winter to propose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the Hessian troops, whose hands were now tied
up from assisting us? or must he wave the subsidy
to them, when they were starving in our cause?
The others went further; they called his Royal
Highness’s Generalship in question; he was brave
indeed, but that was all; he had wasted a good
Army; had beaten the French, and did not know it.</p>

<p>But the most indecent in personal invectives was
Baron Munchausen, the Hanoverian Minister in
England&mdash;a man reckoned one of their ablest heads,
and who had hitherto always comported himself
with civility and inoffensively. He went so far as
to call for a Council to examine the Duke’s behaviour;
and Lord Hardwicke, to extend the insult,
or to divide it amongst many, desired the whole
Cabinet Council, not merely the junto, might meet:
the affair was too serious. Thither Munchausen
brought copies of his own letters to the Duke, to
prove that his Royal Highness had acted without
authority. Mr. Pitt observed, that they proved
the direct contrary; and he, who certainly had
never managed the Duke, nor stood on any good
terms with him, acted a part nobly honest: when
the King told him that he had given his son no
<em>orders</em> for this treaty, Pitt replied with firmness,
“But <em>full powers</em>, Sir; very <em>full powers</em>.”</p>

<p>Yet this sincerity in a foe could infuse none into
a father. Two messengers were dispatched to <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'recal the Duke'">recall
the Duke</ins>, and, October 12th, he arrived at Kensington.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
It was in the evening, and he retired to
his own apartment, where Mr. Fox and his servants
were attending. He thanked Mr. Fox for being
there, and said, “You see me well both in body
and mind. I have written orders in my pocket for
everything I did.” (He afterwards said, his orders
had been so strong, that he had not expected to
obtain such good conditions.) He then dismissed
Fox, saying, he would send for him again. (The
shortness of this interview, he afterwards told Mr.
Fox, had proceeded from his determination of seeing
nobody alone who could be supposed to advise him,
till he had taken the step he meditated.) At nine,
the hour the King punctually goes to play in the
apartment of the Princess Emily, the Duke went
to her. The King, who was there, had ordered the
Princess not to leave them alone, received him with
extreme coldness; and when his Royal Highness
went afterwards into the other room where the King
was at cards, his Majesty said aloud, “Here is my
son, who has ruined me and disgraced himself,”&mdash;and
unless this was speaking to him, spoke not a
word. At eleven, when the cards were over, the
Duke went down to Lady Yarmouth, and told her
the King had left him but one favour to ask, which
he was come to solicit by her interposition, as he
wished to make it as little disagreeable to the King
as possible&mdash;it was to desire leave to resign everything,
the post of Captain-General, and his regiment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
The Countess was in great concern at the
request, and said, “Pray, Sir, don’t determine this
at once.” He replied, “He begged her pardon;
he was not come for advice; he had had time to
think, and was determined.” “Then, Sir,” said
she, “I have nothing left but to obey.”</p>

<p>The King received the notification with as much
real agitation as he had counterfeited before. The
next morning he ordered the Cabinet Council to
wait on the Duke, and pay their respects to him.
Lord Holderness went in first, and kissed his hand,
but was not spoken to. Pitt followed; and of him
his Royal Highness took most notice, speaking to
him at different reprisals with kindness, to mark
his satisfaction with Pitt’s behaviour. He said a
little to the Duke of Newcastle, Lord Granville,
and Lord Anson. Lord Hardwicke was out of town.
The Duke of Devonshire was sent to the Duke in
private, to persuade him not to resign. He was
inflexible. Devonshire was sent again to ask from
the King as a favour that he would at least retain
his regiment; he need not do the duty; but his
Majesty should not think himself safe in any other
hands; yet even this counterfeit of confidence was
an aggravation of the cruelty. The Duke learned
that this solicitude about the regiment proceeded
solely from the King’s averseness to give it to Prince
Edward; as would be expected, and he was not
softened by such duplicity. He even determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
never to be employed under his father again, telling
Fox, that no collusion about the treaty should be
imputed to him, by his resuming his command. To
Conway he said, he could not, did not hope that the
King would do what was necessary to justify him,
it was therefore necessary to do all he could to justify
himself. The next day, the Duke visited the
Princess, and beginning to mention his resolution
of resigning, she rung the bell, and asked him if he
would not see the children.</p>

<p>When the King found his son’s resentment
inflexible, he thought of nothing but making it as
little uncomfortable to himself as possible: provided
the interior face of the palace was not discomposed,
he cared little about justifying himself
or making any reparation to his son; who, he
thought, might as easily forget in the ceremonies of
the drawing-room what he had suffered, as his
Majesty drowned all sensibility in the parade of
that narrow sphere. He insisted that the Duke
should appear as usual at Court, and come to him
in a morning. The Duke acquiesced, saying, he
should always show the utmost respect to the King
as his father, but never could serve him more.
When these <em>essential</em> forms were adjusted, the
Duke sent for Munchausen, and said, “Mr. Privy-councillor,
I hear the King has sent for opinions of
Hanoverian Generals on my conduct; here are the
opinions of the Hessian Generals, and of the Duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of Wolfenbuttle. As the King has ordered the
former to be deposited among the Archives of
Hanover, I hope he will do me the justice to let
these be registered with them. Take them, and
bring them back to me to-morrow.” Munchausen
returned with them the next day, and with a message
from the King that his Majesty had been
better informed, and thought better of his Royal
Highness than he had done; and then Munchausen
falling prostrate to kiss the lappet of his coat, the
Duke with dignity and anger checked him, and
said, “Mr. Privy-councillor, confine yourself to
that office; and take care what you say, even though
the words you repeat should be my father’s; I have
all possible deference for him, but I know how to
punish anybody else that presumes to speak improperly
of me.”</p>

<p>On the 15th, the Duke resigned all his commands.</p>

<p>I have dwelt minutely on the circumstances of
this history, having learned from the best authorities,
and being sure that few transactions deserve
more to be remembered. A young Prince, warm,
greedy of military glory, yet resigning all his passions
to the interested dictates of a father’s pleasure,
and then loaded with the imputation of having acted
basely without authority: hurt with unmerited
disgrace, yet never breaking out into the least
unguarded expression; preserving dignity under
oppression, and the utmost tenderness of duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
under the utmost delicacy of honour&mdash;this an uncommon
picture&mdash;for the sake of human nature, I
hope the conduct of the father is uncommon too!
When the Duke could tear himself from his favourite
passion, the Army, one may judge how sharply he
must have been wounded. When afterwards the
King, perfidiously enough, broke that famous convention,
mankind were so equitable as to impute it
to the same unworthy politics, not to the disapprobation
he had pretended to feel on its being made.
In a former part of this history, I have said with
regard to his eldest, that the King might have
been an honest man, if he had never hated his
father, or had ever loved his son&mdash;what double force
has this truth, when it is again applied to him on
his treachery to the best son that ever lived!
Considering with what freedom I have spoken of
the Duke’s faults in other parts of this work, I
may be believed in the just praise bestowed on him
here.</p>

<p>We must now turn our eyes to Ireland, which
Mr. Conway had left in a state of perfect tranquillity.
The imprudence of the new Governors
opened the wounds afresh. The Duke of Bedford
set out for that Kingdom on the 20th of September,
determined as he thought to observe a strict neutrality
between the factions, and rigid uprightness
in the conduct of his Administration. He began
with exacting strict attendance on their posts from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
persons in employment, and with refusing leave
of absence to officers and chaplains of regiments;
and considering, too, how his new dominions had
been loaded of late years to smooth the difficulties
of the English Government, his Grace commenced his
reign with strong declamations against Irish pensions.
He had two difficulties to encounter before these fair
views could be carried into execution: his own Court
were far from being so disinterested as their master,
and his new subjects were as little desirous of a
reign of virtue. Nor had the Duke himself the art
of reconciling them to it by his manner, which was
shy, untractable, ungracious, ungenerous. The
Duchess pleased universally; she had all her life
been practising the part of a Queen; dignity and
dissimulation were natural to her. The Irish were
charmed with a woman who seemed to depart from
her state from mere affability. But the person who
influenced them both was the Secretary Rigby. He
had ingratiated himself with the Duchess, and had
acquired an absolute ascendant over her husband,
who, with all his impetuosity, was governed by his
favourite in a style that approached to domineering.</p>

<p>Rigby had an advantageous and manly person,
recommended by a spirited jollity that was very
pleasing, though sometimes roughened into brutality:
of most insinuating good-breeding when he
wished to be agreeable. His passions were turbulent
and overbearing; his courage bold and fond of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
exerting itself. His parts strong and quick, but
totally uncultivated; and so much had he trusted
to unaffected common sense, that he could never
afterwards acquire the necessary temperament of
art in his public speaking. He had been a pupil of
Winnington, and owed the chief errors of his life to
that man’s maxims, perniciously witty. Winnington
had unluckily lived when all virtue had been
set to notorious sale, and in ridicule of false pretences
had affected an honesty in avowing whatever
was dishonourable. Rigby, whose heart was naturally
good, grew to think it sensible to laugh at the
shackles of morality; and having early encumbered
his fortune by gaming, he found his patron’s maxims
but too well adapted to retrieve his desperate
fortunes. He placed his honour in steady addiction
to whatever faction he was united with: and
from the gaiety of his temper, having indulged
himself in profuse drinking, (for in private few men
were more temperate,) he was often hurried beyond
the bounds of that interest which he meant should
govern all his actions, and which his generous
extravagance for ever combated. In short, he
was a man who was seldom loved or hated with
moderation; yet he himself, though a violent opponent,
was never a bitter enemy. His amiable
qualities were all natural; his faults acquired, or
fatally linked to him by the chain of some other
failings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>In a Court of such a complexion as I have
described, no wonder the reign of virtue was violated
in the outset. The Queen-Dowager of Prussia,
the King’s sister, was lately dead: during the parsimonious
barbarity of her husband, a pension of
800<em>l.</em> a year, on Ireland, had been privately transmitted
to her; and she retained it to her death.
The Duke of Bedford was persuaded to ask this for
the Duchess’s sister, Lady Betty Waldegrave, and
obtained it. His impartiality was as ill-observed
as his maxims of frugality. Rigby, sacrificing
to what he concluded Mr. Fox’s inclination,
hurried the Lord-Lieutenant into flagrant partiality
to Lord Kildare. The Primate was neglected;
but he knew how to make himself of consequence.
The prostitution of his opponents had
raised his character, and he omitted no address to
conciliate popularity. Malone had at length accepted
the office of Chancellor of the Exchequer;
and being the last renegade, was the most obnoxious.
Being regarded as Minister in the House of Commons,
the storm was intended to fall on him, for
Rigby was not known as a man of business; and
till Lord George Sackville affected the active part
of power, and after him Mr. Conway, the Lord-Lieutenant’s
secretary had been no character in
Parliament.</p>

<p>The factions existing were, the Primate’s, Lord
Kildare’s, those attached to the Speaker Ponsonby,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and who in truth were a defection from Kildare;
and a flying squadron of patriots, the smallest body
of the four, and composed as is usual, of the discontented&mdash;that
is, of those who had been too insignificant
to be bought off, or whose demands had
been too high&mdash;and of a few well-meaning men. Lord
Kildare had still the greatest number of dependents,
though inferior to those of the Primate and Ponsonby,
if united; a point<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> now eagerly pursued by
the Archbishop, while at the same time he underhand
inflamed the patriots against the Castle: and
had sufficient success. The Session no sooner
opened, than French, a lawyer, proposed a trifling
amendment to the Address, but with indirect
reflections on Malone, whom they endeavoured to
make rise, and take the Minister upon him; but he
avoided it, and suffered the amendment. The next
day, one Upton, a warm and obstinate Patriot,
formerly a friend of Malone, moved for the list of
Pensions, on which Lady Betty Waldegrave’s name
must have appeared. Malone at last rose, and said,
the Motion was premature, for the list would be
given in with the Estimates. Upton, not being
content with this answer, Malone moved to adjourn,
the other threatening to renew his Motion at their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
next meeting. And when he did repeat it, it was
rejected but by a majority of five; an advantage
so slender, that the Castle did not venture to
stem a torrent of violent resolutions, which the
House passed a few days afterwards against pensions,
absentees, and other grievances, of which
they demanded redress, desiring the Lord-Lieutenant
to transmit them to his Majesty in their very
words. This heat was led by one Perry, a bold,
troublesome, and corrupt lawyer, who had been
vexatious to Mr. Conway, and between whom and
Rigby there soon passed such warm altercations,
that they were with difficulty prevented from going
greater lengths.</p>

<p>The Duke, in answer to their resolutions, told them
they were couched in such extraordinary terms,
and aimed so high, that he should take time to consider
whether he would transmit them to England;
and this answer Rigby moved to have entered in
the Journals, but desisted, on finding great opposition.
Both the Duke and he acted with incredible
intemperance; and intending to establish their authority
by the weight of power, his Grace sent to
England for assistance, and demanded to be invested
with a latitude of rewards and punishments. The
absentees were sent over to strengthen his party in
the House of Commons; but the English Council
meeting upon his other demand, and not being composed
of many of his friends, Mr. Pitt wrote him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
civil excuse, with a refusal of full powers; if his
Grace would name whom he wished to displace or
prefer, he should be supported; on the whole, he
was advised to compose the heats that had arisen.
The Primate no doubt had early intelligence from
Lord George of the little attention paid to the
Lord Lieutenant’s remonstrance; but being disposed
to govern the Castle rather than overturn
them, he retired to his country seat at Leixlip,
declaring his disapprobation of the violence of the
Commons; and the next day sent two of his creatures
to the Duke to disavow any connexions with
the Speaker, and to profess his aversion to disturbing
the Government; in elections only against Lord
Kildare and Malone he proposed to interfere. On
the other hand, Lord Kildare protested that if the
Primate was left of the Regency, he would not be of
it. A menace most indifferent to the Prelate, who
could forgive anything but exclusion from power,
and who on his former disgrace had much resented
the part his brother had acted in consenting to his
being laid aside; and when it was notified to him,
he broke out, “Now will my wise brother write me
four sides to tell me it is all for the better.”</p>

<p>The dissimulation of the Primate was soon detected:
the Duke of Bedford, to oblige him, had
preferred Cunningham in rank, who, however, voted
against the Court in the strongest questions. Yet
continuing to frequent the assemblies at the Castle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the Duke took him aside, reproached him with his
behaviour, and told him, the bread he eat was the
King’s. The young man replied honestly, he had
such obligations to the Primate and Lord George,
that though he should be reduced to his pristine
indigence, he would act in all things as they ordered
him. Some days afterwards, the Opposition calling
in question the great powers exercised by the Privy
Council of Ireland, and Malone sitting silent, the
Solicitor-General, a friend of the Primate, said,
that, as an officer of the Crown, he could not sit
still and see the prerogative attacked, without
marking his disapprobation. He was joined by all
the Primate’s friends, and the motion for abridging
those powers was rejected by 140 to 40. This more
civil way of displaying to the Castle the Primate’s
interest in the House was not calculated to inspire
them with less awe of his strength.</p>

<p>Lord Kildare (who had no talents for governing,
and yet would not unite with anybody that had,)
declined Mr. Fox’s advice of joining with the
Speaker, by which he might have balanced the efforts
of the Primate. The Earl thought of repelling the
war by carrying it into the quarters of the enemy,
and the Castle weakly concurred in this silly project.
They determined to move for an inquiry into
the conduct of the Commissioners of the Revenue
for the last twenty years, in which the principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
retrospect would involve the partizans of the House
of Dorset. The execution of the measure was delegated
to Sir Archibald Atcheson, a man so insignificant,
that, having acquainted the House that he
had a Motion of consequence to propose on the
following Monday, he was so little regarded, that
when the day came, the House was remarkably
empty. The Courtiers opposed the question, till
Rigby rose and said, a Motion from so respectable
a person must be of consequence; the gentleman,
he supposed, had some mismanagement to lay open.
A secret Committee was immediately proposed and
elected by ballot, when, to the great confusion of the
Ministers, they carried but three out of thirty-one; the
other twenty-eight were all elected from the creatures
of the Primate and Speaker. The Castle had no more
success in the popularity they expected from this
inquisition, than they had in the choice of the inquisitors.
The Lord-Lieutenant, too, increased the
offence by his ungracious reception of the Commissioners
of the Revenue, who waiting on him to
disculpate themselves, as they feared they had been
misrepresented to his Grace, he answered them dryly,
if anything was wrong, he supposed it would come
out; if innocent, they would clear themselves.</p>

<p>These transactions, which reached to the end of
the year, I have chosen to throw together, as they
would be little intelligible, if broken into the precise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
order in which they happened. I shall use the
same method on the sequel of the expedition to
Rochfort.</p>

<p>As soon as the Fleet was returned, Sir John Mordaunt
was ordered to town to give an account of his
conduct; and Mr. Pitt inserted in the Gazette his
letter to the General and Admiral, empowering
them to stay out longer if they should find it necessary.
This did not allay the ill-humour in the City,
where they coupled the fruitlessness of the expedition
with the Hanoverian neutrality; and concluded
that both flowed from the same attention to the
preservation of the favourite Electorate. The
Ministers affected to distinguish the <em>naval</em> commanders.
The Generals were coldly received, particularly
by the King, though he did speak to Conway,
who, however, was so sensible of the injustice
done to him, that, if he had not been overpersuaded
by his friends, who foresaw that his resignation
would be represented as a dismission, he would
have immediately quitted his post in the King’s
Bed-chamber.</p>

<p>His Majesty had at first been indifferent to the
plan; then ridiculed it to all who came near him.
Now, being in a humour of heroism and criticism,
he took it up in the bitterest terms, and did the
Generals the honour of treating them as ill as his
own son, the Duke, seizing every opportunity of
casting reflections on the one and the others; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
on the news of the King of Prussia’s success, the
Monarch said, “Yes, people may beat, if they do
not always retreat; but there are so many cowards,
I am almost afraid of growing one myself.” Pitt,
though really more hurt, and apt enough to take
any step to illustrate his own measures, behaved
with greater decency. He pressed no violent resolutions
against the officers; he prevented the City
from addressing against them; and only took the
more sensible, though not less severe style of punishing
the miscarriage, by raising Wolfe at once
over the heads of a great number of officers.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Sir John Mordaunt finding no notice taken of
him in any shape, went to Mr. Pitt, and told him
he had waited a week to see what would be done on
his affair: he found he was in disgrace, but found
it only by neglect and silence. He entreated Mr.
Pitt to ask the King to permit an inquiry on it.
Pitt told him, this had been thought of; owned they
did blame the first Council of War; but this was
always the case when officers went prejudiced against
a measure.</p>

<p>Accordingly, November 1st, a Commission of Inquiry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
was directed, composed of the Duke of Marlborough,
Lord George Sackville, and General
Waldegrave: a Court that could not be called
unprecedented, for one of the very same nature had
been held in the foregoing year, but most unconstitutional
and dangerous; nay, absurd, for they had
neither power to acquit nor condemn. As the
Ministers selected whom they pleased, if the criminal
was to be saved, a favourable report from this
Board would exclude a legal trial; if to be condemned,
was not such a preparatory inquisition
likely to influence future judgment? The present
Board was indeed artfully constituted. Two of the
Commissioners were attached to Fox; if their majority
acquitted, the odium would fall on Mr. Pitt’s
antagonist&mdash;and to them he had joined Lord George
Sackville, as much devoted to himself, and more
than a balance to the other two in abilities. But
another step Pitt took, still more novel, and as pernicious
for the precedent. He sent Mr. Blair of the
Secretary’s office to the Lord Mayor of London, to
inform the City that an inquiry was appointed.
What right the City of London had to such notification
above all other towns in the kingdom could
not well be told. What use they will make of such
admission into the executive part of Government
can easily be conceived; and what confusion may
follow from incorporating the mob of London with
the other parts of the Legislature, where they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
already represented, and where they have no title to
be more than represented.</p>

<p>The inquiry began on the 12th. The Generals,
and Knowles, and Broderick, utterly disavowing Sir
Edward Hawke’s minutes, Lord George took them
to pieces severely, and censured Hay, the composer
of them. The Duke of Marlborough asked many
questions, with appearance of thinking ill of the
conduct of the Generals. Waldegrave took no part
at all. Sir John Mordaunt defended himself weakly;
Conway most ably; exposed Clarke; and at last
producing his own narrative, it silenced all further
inquiry; yet the resolutions of the Court, which were
not explicit, seemed to say, that they thought more
might have been performed; or at least that there
had not been sufficient reasons for desisting from
the attempt. The report of these opinions was made
to the King on the 21st, who, on the 30th, ordered
a Court-Martial on Sir John Mordaunt alone.</p>

<p>The Duke of Cumberland<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> espoused the cause of
the Generals, wished them to make it a common
cause, and to pin down their whole defence to the
impracticability of the measure. To this Conway
could not consent. He had too much endeavoured
to explore whether it was practicable or not, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
submit to involve himself in the remissness of those
for whose sake he now suffered. Yet the delicacy
with which he avoided whatever might set their
failings in a strong light, the management he used
invariably for Sir John Mordaunt, for whom he
drew up every paper he could want, the obstinacy
with which he persisted to sink material articles of
his own defence, rather than charge his colleagues,
at the same time that no worthy mind was ever so
wounded with disgrace, these and every instance of
his behaviour made the solidity of his virtue appear
most amiable and interesting; and it was still
heightened by not meeting with an equal degree of
tenderness from those in whose protection it was
exerted.</p>

<p>The Court-Martial began its session on the 14th
of December, and finished on the 18th; though it
was opened again for one day to hear Sir Edward
Hawke’s evidence, who had been at sea. Lord
Tyrawley was President. Mr. Pitt appeared before
them, as he said, to authenticate his own orders,
but took the opportunity of making an imperious
speech, and defended Clarke and Thierri, the pilot;
who, he affirmed, had supported their information,
though sifted in so extraordinary a manner. General
Cholmondeley interrupted him, reminding him that
he only came thither to authenticate. Pitt replied
with haughtiness; and being asked, who had sifted
Clarke and the pilot, he said, the military men; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
often spoke of Mordaunt and Conway by name.
There have been times when a Minister, in less
odour of popularity, would have been impeached for
presuming to awe a legal Court of Justice; but as
it did Mr. Pitt no harm, neither did it produce any
good to the cause he favoured. The whole Court
treated the expedition as rash and childish; and
acquitted the General with honour. Sir Edward
Hawke reflecting on Thierri as an ignorant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fanfaron</i>,
General Cholmondeley asked if there were two
Thierris? Surely, he said, this ignorant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fanfaron</i>
could not be the one so applauded by Mr. Pitt!</p>

<p>Thus ended the chimera of taking Rochfort. The
public, however, were entertained for part of the
following winter with a literary controversy, which
it produced between General Conway and Mr.
Potter. Mr. Doddington, too, flung in one or two
bitter pamphlets against Mr. Pitt.</p>

<p>I have dwelt so long on the singular events of
this year, that I shall hasten to the conclusion of
this book, touching briefly the other most material
passages, the chief of which, relating to the victories
of the King of Prussia, will be found at large in
other histories, and demand a more exalted pen than
mine, sullied with the faults and follies of my
countrymen, and though suited perhaps to the trifling
province of catching ridicules, unequal to the
lofty compass of history.</p>

<p>Lord Mansfield was called to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conciliabulum</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
or essence of the Council; an honour not only uncommon
and due to his high abilities, but set off
with his being proposed by Lord Hardwicke himself,
who wished, he said, to get repose for three months
in the country: Lord Mansfield would amply supply
his place. It was about this time that this great
Chief Justice set himself to take information against
libels, and would sift, he said, what was the real
liberty of the press. The occasions of the times had
called him off from principles that favoured an arbitrary
King&mdash;he still leaned towards an arbitrary
Government.</p>

<p>At the end of October came news that our Fleet
under Holbourn, blocking up a French squadron at
Louisbourg, had been dispersed by a great storm,
in which the Nassau was lost, the Eagle was driven
home, and ten ships were dismasted.</p>

<p>The year concluded with a torrent of glory for
the King of Prussia. On the 5th of November, he
defeated the combined Imperial and French Armies
at Rosbach; and though the Austrians took Schweidnitz,
and beat the Prince of Bevern, the King
repaired that disadvantage by a complete victory
over their best Army, commanded by Prince Charles
and Count Daun, at Lissa: a single month intervening
between this and his success at Rosbach.
His uncle’s efforts were neither exerted nor crowned
with equal honour. The decline of the arms of
France in the empire encouraged the King to break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the convention of Closter Seven. The Hanoverians
were reassembled, and Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick,
a general of repute, appointed to command
them. Some trifling infractions of the neutrality on
the part of the French were pretexted to cover this
notorious breach of faith&mdash;a monument to future
politicians, in how short a space of time a treaty
may be commanded, concluded, disavowed, made
advantage of, and violated!</p>

<p>During these transactions, the unfortunate Queen
of Poland died suddenly at Dresden; a witness of
calamities to which she had not contributed, and
which she had in vain remained there to temper.</p>

<p>In England, Sir John Ligonier, to whom the
supreme command of the British armies was entrusted,
was created a Viscount of Ireland, and a
Marshal, with his seniors, Sir Robert Rich and
Lord Molesworth. Lord George Sackville succeeded
as Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance; and
by that employment escaped the unwelcome command
in America, which he could not with any
grace have otherwise avoided.</p>

<p>Colley Cibber, that good-humoured and honest
veteran, so unworthily aspersed by Pope, and whose
Memoirs, with one or two of his comedies, will
secure his fame, in spite of all the abuse of his <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'cotemporaries, dying'">contemporaries,
dying</ins> about this time at a very great
age, the Duke of Devonshire bestowed the laurel on
Mr. Whitehead, a man of a placid genius. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Grace had first designed it for Gray,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> then for
Mason, but was told that both would decline it.
In truth, it was not Cibber’s silly odes that disgraced
the employment, but an annual panegyric
venally extorted for whatever King, and with or
without occasion, that debased the office. Gray,
crowned with the noblest wreaths of Parnassus,
could not stoop to be dubbed poet by a Lord Chamberlain;
and Mason, though he had not then displayed
all the powers of his genius, had too much
sense and spirit to owe his literary fame to anything
but his own merit.</p>

<p>On the 28th of December died the King’s third
daughter, Princess Caroline. She had been the
favourite of the Queen, who preferred her understanding
to those of all her other daughters, and
whose partiality she returned with duty, gratitude,
affection, and concern. Being in ill health at the
time of her mother’s death, the Queen told her she
would follow her in less than a year. The Princess
received the notice as a prophecy; and though she
lived many years after it had proved a vain one,
she quitted the world, and persevered in the closest
retreat, and in constant and religious preparation
for the grave; a moment she so eagerly desired,
that when something was once proposed to her, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
which she was averse, she said, “I would not do it
to die!” To this impression of melancholy had
contributed the loss of Lord Hervey,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> for whom she
had conceived an unalterable passion, constantly
marked afterwards by all kind and generous offices
to his children. For many years she was totally an
invalid, and shut herself up in two chambers in the
inner part of St. James’s, from whence she could
not see a single object. In this monastic retirement,
with no company but of the King, the Duke,
Princess Emily, and a few of the most intimate of
the Court, she led, not an unblameable life only,
but a meritorious one: her whole income was dispensed
between generosity and charity; and, till her
death by shutting up the current discovered the
source, the jails of London did not suspect that the
best support of their wretched inhabitants was
issued from the Palace.</p>

<p>From the last Sunday to the Wednesday on
which she died, she declined seeing her family; and
when the mortification began, and the pain ceased,
she said, “I feared I should not have died of
this!”</p>

Fitzroy (Charles, afterwards Lord Southampton, from whom
I received this relation), he said, “Now, if they would not

made so much noise, and the courage of the Generals was
questioned, Lord Chesterfield said to Mr. Fox these words:
“I am sure Conway is brave; I remember when I was
praising George Stanhope (a young man of remarkable spirit,
brother of Earl Stanhope), he replied, ‘Faith, my Lord, I
believe I have as much courage as other people; indeed, I
don’t pretend to be like Harry Conway, who walks up to the

was going to dance a minuet.’”</p></div>

<p>Pitt was now arrived at undisturbed possession
of that influence in affairs at which his ambition
had aimed, and which his presumption had made
him flatter himself he could exert like those men
of superior genius, whose talents have been called
forth by some crisis to retrieve a sinking nation.
He had said the last year to the Duke of Devonshire,
“My Lord, I am sure I can save this country,
and nobody else can.” It were ingratitude to
him to say that he did not give such a reverberation
to our stagnating Councils, as exceedingly
altered the appearance of our fortune. He warded
off the evil hour that seemed approaching; he infused
vigour into our arms; he taught the nation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to speak again as England used to speak to Foreign
Powers; and so far from dreading invasions from
France, he affected to turn us into invaders. Indeed,
those efforts were so puny, so ill-concerted, so
ineffectual to any essential purpose, that France
looked down with scorn on such boyish flippancies,
which Pitt deemed heroic, which Europe thought
ridiculous, and which humanity saw were only
wasteful of lives, and precedents of a more barbarous
warfare than France had hitherto been
authorized to carry on. In fact, Pitt had neither
all the talents he supposed in himself, nor which he
seemed to possess from the vacancy of great men
around him. Thinly, very thinly, were great men
sown in my remembrance: I can pretend to have
seen but five; the Duke of Cumberland, Sir Robert
Walpole, Lord Granville, Lord Mansfield, and Pitt.
I have expatiated on all their characters separately;
and yet I am inclined to say a few words more in
the light of comparison. It is by setting the same
characters in different oppositions and points of
view, that nearer acquaintance with them may be
struck out.</p>

<p>Lord Granville was most a genius of the five:
he conceived, knew, expressed whatever he pleased.
The state of Europe and the state of literature were
equally familiar to him. His eloquence was rapid,
and flowed from a source of wit, grandeur, and
knowledge. So far from premeditated, he allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
no reflection to chasten it. It was entertaining, it
was sublime, it was hyperbole, it was ridiculous,
according as the profusion of ideas crowded from
him. He embraced systems like a legislator, but
was capable of none of the detail of a magistrate.
Sir Robert Walpole was much the reverse: he
knew mankind, not their writings; he consulted
their interests, not their systems; he intended their
happiness, not their grandeur. Whatever was beyond
common sense, he disregarded. Lord Mansfield,
without the elevation of Lord Granville, had
great powers of eloquence. It was a most accurate
understanding, and yet capable of shining in whatever
it was applied to. He was as free from vice as
Pitt, more unaffected, and formed to convince, even
where Pitt had dazzled. The Duke of Cumberland
had most expressive sense, but with that connexion
between his sense and sensibility, that you must
mortify his pride before you could call out the radiance
of his understanding. Being placed at the
head of armies without the shortest apprenticeship,
no wonder he miscarried: it is cruel to have no
other master than one’s own faults. Pitt’s was an
unfinished greatness: considering how much of it
depended on his words, one may almost call his an
artificial greatness; but his passion for fame and
the grandeur of his ideas compensated for his defects.
He aspired to redeem the honour of his
country, and to place it in a point of giving law to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
nations. His ambition was to be the most illustrious
man of the first country in Europe; and he
thought that the eminence of glory could not be
sullied by the steps to it being passed irregularly.
He wished to aggrandize Britain in general, but
thought not of obliging or benefiting individuals.</p>

<p>Lord Granville you loved till you knew him; Sir
Robert Walpole, the more you knew him: you would
have loved the Duke, if you had not feared him.
Pitt liked the dignity of despotism; Lord Mansfield
the reality: yet the latter would have served
the cause of power, without sharing it: Pitt would
have set the world free, if he might not command
it. Lord Granville would have preferred doing
right, if he had not thought it more convenient to
do wrong: Sir Robert Walpole meant to serve
mankind, though he knew how little they deserved
it; and this principle is at once the most meritorious
in oneself and to the world. I beg pardon
for this digression.</p>

<p>The Parliament had opened on the first of December
in the last year; and, as if to notify honestly,
that Germany would not be proscribed by Mr. Pitt,
the King’s Speech talked openly of the defence of
his Majesty’s dominions of Britain and <em>elsewhere</em>.
By that little word <em>elsewhere</em>, Hanover was incorporated
into the very language of Parliament. Lord
Westmoreland, in the Lords, spoke with applause
against re-echoing Addresses, and universal submission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to a Minister. In the Commons, Mr. Fox
was absent on the death of his favourite nephew,
Lord Digby; and <em>elsewhere</em> passed as if a phrase
of course, like the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed.
Yet on the 14th, when Lord Barrington, on delivering
the estimate of the Army, had complaisantly
reverberated the word <em>elsewhere</em>, Mr. Pitt himself
said, he did not agree with his Lordship in that
term; he meant the Army for our immediate selves.
He had never been against continental measures
when practicable; but would not now send a drop
of our blood to the Elbe, to be lost in that ocean of
gore. Other parts of this speech, admired almost
beyond any of his orations, were so fine, and so
bombast, that I must just mention a few, though
I do not intend to fatigue the reader with more
speeches: those I have given are sufficient to illustrate
our oratory.</p>

<p>Sir John Philipps had spoken dully, Beckford
wildly, dropping this expression, “He did not know
in what hands we were.” Lord George Sackville
had made the apology of Lord Loudun, whose idle
conduct in America was much censured; yet where
Lord George wished to have him remain, lest, on a
change of commanders, he himself should be named.
Pitt said, “In what hands were we?&mdash;in those of
a most gracious King:” on whom he made a panegyric,
and of which the least part was not his Majesty’s
goodness to him since he last took the Seals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
How the King had listened even to him, though
least in Administration&mdash;though least, he hoped to
continue in it with honour: and he spoke of the
great concord among the Ministers. But nothing
could be well till the Army was subjected to the
civil power: they were to obey, not to reason.
Those sent on the late expedition had laughed at it
even at table&mdash;nay, so had some of the Cabinet.
He warmed himself on this topic, though he knew,
he said, he ought not, as the commander was actually
under trial. On Lord Loudun he kept no
measures at all, but loaded him with all the asperity
peculiar to his style&mdash;he had scarce any hopes now,
though the people paid such an army in America:
not only nothing was done&mdash;nothing was attempted.
We had lost all the waters; we had not a boat on
them now. Every door there was open to France.
Though Lord George had excused, he could not; he
would not condemn, yet he believed against Lord
Loudun, who might have recovered our affairs if he
had not loitered from the 9th of July to the 5th of
August, inquiring whether or no the French were
superior: indeed, for himself, our ill success had
hurt his quiet and tainted his health. He then
burst out into an Eastern panegyric. There he
found Watson, Pococke, and Clive:&mdash;what astonishing
success had Watson had with only three ships,
which had been laid up for some time on land! He
did not stay to careen this, and condemn that, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
at once sailed into the body of the Ganges. He was
supported by Clive, that man, not born for a desk;
<em>that heaven-born General</em>, whose magnanimity,
resolution, determination, and execution would
charm a King of Prussia; and whose presence of
mind astonished the Indies!</p>

<p>These heroes soon added new wreaths to those
with which Mr. Pitt had crowned them. The King
of Prussia took Breslau, and made prisoners an
Army of Generals and ten thousand men: and the
letters of the following month brought accounts of
such victories and riches acquired by Clive as
astonished Europe as much as the Indies. Discovering
that the Nabob who ruled in that quarter
was encouraged by the French to break his alliance
with us, and was actually on the march to attack
our settlements, Clive bribed his first Minister, who,
expediting his treachery in a more summary way
than is usual in this part of the world, murdered
his master; and then Clive, at the head of only
three thousand men, and with a bravery that deserved
a better foundation than the assassination of
an enemy, attacked and defeated an army of thirty-five
thousand. The new Nabob, established by
Clive’s influence, made immense presents to our
fleet and East India Company. Clive’s share
amounted to above 200,000<em>l.</em> Admiral Watson, to
whom the Red Riband was destined, died of a fever
two days after the engagement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>General Abercrombie was sent to command in
America; a man who signalized himself neither before
nor after his advancement. Five new Brigadier-Generals
and three Colonels, with rank only in
our colonies, were appointed to serve under him.
Amherst had a separate command, with Wolfe for
second. These officers were all selected by Pitt,
who contented himself with always speaking of the
affair of Rochfort as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">res intentata</i>, and with keeping
the commanders on that expedition unemployed;
though Conway, in the most earnest terms, and by
every interest he could use, begged to serve in any
quality, and in any part of the world. He was refused:
and even when the English staff was carried
in to the King by Ligonier, his Majesty struck out
the names of Mordaunt, Conway, and Cornwallis.
Ligonier represented Conway’s eagerness for employment,
and that his case was different from Mordaunt’s&mdash;he
had tried to do something. “Yes,”
said the King, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">après diné la moutarde</i>.” However,
he said he would think of Conway, though
not then.</p>

<p>In Ireland, affairs grew to a crisis. The Opposition
were inflamed with resentment at the Secret
Committee set up by the Duke of Bedford, the
management of which they had wrested from him.
As the season, too, approached for the departure of
the Lord Lieutenant, the Primate had no time to
lose for recovering his place in the Regency. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
reason of policy and decency made it more eligible
to him to obtain that situation by gentle means
than by violence. He and Ponsonby offered terms
to the Duke of Bedford, who, though confessing
their superiority in the House of Commons, refused
to unite with them. In truth, he had involved
himself so much with Lord Kildare, and was so
unwilling to disoblige Fox by disobliging that Lord,
that he knew not how to extricate himself. If Kildare
would have softened towards the Primate, the
accommodation would soon have been completed;
but he would not desert himself; and he knew his
party would desert him if once reconciled to the
Prelate. More, the Black Rod, was dispatched to
England to consult Mr. Fox; the Duke hoping in
the meantime to be able to govern independently
of either party.</p>

<p>The first step he took towards the system only
tended to make it more impracticable. A Judge’s
place falling vacant, the Lord Lieutenant, to demonstrate
his impartiality, offered the nomination
to the Chancellor, who recommended Malone’s
greatest enemy, a creature of the Primate, and one
formerly employed by Lord George Sackville to
write pamphlets on their side. His preferment,
thus obtained, was no obligation to the Primate:
Malone resented it strongly, and soon took an opportunity
of exerting his resentment. The Secret
Committee got enlarged powers, intending to turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
them against the Duke of Bedford’s Treasury; and
the party in general hurried to hostilities.</p>

<p>The Lord Lieutenant’s secretary was a place of
great profit, if in the hands of an intelligent and
interested man. He had fees from every new commission
in the army; and his selling regiments and
subordinate ranks had long passed as a matter
scarce to be disavowed. If he had great power
over his patron, and none over himself, Bishoprics
and every other preferment in the gift or at the
recommendation of the Lord Lieutenant were marketable
at the secretary’s apartments in the Castle.
But it was on the death of a King that the secretaryship
was largely lucrative. He touched for
every renewal of commission and patent. With
some of these advantages, Mr. Conway had been a
sufferer by the employment. The table and equipage
are very expensive for the year of the Lord
Lieutenant’s residence in Ireland. It is the second,
the fallow<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> year, that indemnifies both the master
and the servant; and the Duke of Devonshire
quitted before their second year.</p>

<p>Mr. Conway had disdained the least gratification
for his interest; and as often as the Duke of Devonshire
offered him the nomination of regiments and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
commissions, he constantly recommended neglected
officers, who deserved the station, and were too
indigent to reward the service, for which Conway
scorned to be rewarded. The great age of the King,
joined to the other inducements I have mentioned,
had been the principal object that had shone in
Rigby’s eyes when he carried the Duke of Bedford
to Ireland; but that prospect the Opposition now
cut off; and while their patriotism was only sharpened
by popularity, it happily served to disburthen
poor officers from so heavy a tribute. They proposed
a question, which, by the ill-humour of
Malone, was carried without a negative, that the
Lord Lieutenant’s secretary ought to have no fees
for commissions; that the loss ought to be made up
to him in some other way. The King, when this
resolution came to England, ordered the secretary’s
salary to be 2500<em>l.</em> a year. The blow was heavy,
and had its effect.</p>

<p>The Primate, having demonstrated his power,
showed he was not implacable. Lord Fane, of
whose integrity the Duke of Bedford had the greatest
opinion&mdash;and with some reason, for it was like his
own, founded on a partial degree of sense, and easily
misled to very contrary purposes&mdash;was then in Ireland.
To him the Primate sent Lord Hilsborough’s
uncle, Mr. Hill, with new offers of accommodation.
Lord Fane carried them; but at first the Duke of
Bedford was deaf. Lord Fane went again; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Duchess and Rigby were present, and to disguise
their inclinations to the treaty, affected to receive
him with the same coldness as the Duke did; by
which stale art the Duke thought them of his
opinion, till they had time to make him of theirs;
and then the negotiation was easily carried on,
and the Primate restored to his usual power in
the Government, where, when once reinstated, he
became the sole arbiter of affairs. He avoided
interfering with Rigby’s traffic; he assured the
Duchess of the homage of her subjects, and secured
her return to them; and he had too much insinuation
not to charm the Duke himself, who departed
to England, smiling and self-satisfied, though sold
by one<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> man and vanquished by another! Offers
were made to Lord Kildare of being included in
this treaty, which he refused, quitting his part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the Regency, but professing to avoid future hostilities.
The Primate and the Speaker were left
Lords Justices; the third place, Lord Kildare’s [one
must have lived in England and seen the abandoned
behaviour of <em>our</em> patriots before one could believe
it], was filled by Lord Shannon; that very Mr.
Boyle, for whom Lord Kildare had commenced all
these disturbances, and whose opposition to the Primate
had first introduced <em>virtue</em>, and consequently
prostitution, into Ireland. Malone, too, kept his
place, and Sir Richard Cox<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> was made a Commissioner
of the Revenue.</p>

<p>Before I quit the affairs of that country, I must
mention a spiritual business that made some noise
there. Dr. Clayton, Bishop of Clogher, had already
distinguished himself as a man of parts and a freethinker.
His Essay on Spirit, which seemed to
accord with Clarke’s esoteric doctrine, had more the
address of an heresiarch than the plain-dealing simplicity
of a Christian pastor. He now published a
vindication of the Testament, which seemed calculated
for doing anything with the Testament rather
than supporting it. Yet the man was believed sincere
in his opinions&mdash;and so a man ought to be who
thinks it worth his while to expose himself by exploding
any common prejudices. He even aspired
to sufferings for his zeal in propagating counterband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
metaphysics among illiterate Irish. But the Bishops,
his brethren, taking the alarm, and intending a
meeting with their <em>orthodox</em> Primate, in order to
prepare an application to the Crown for a royal
visitation, Clayton died suddenly of a panic, though
possessed of a good private estate, and ambitious of
martyrdom!</p>

<p>This little flame was soon extinguished; in fact,
there were no religious combustibles in the temper
of the times. Popery and Protestantism seemed at
a stand. The modes of Christianity were exhausted,
and could not furnish novelty enough to fix attention.
Linzendorffe plied his Moravians with nudities,
yet made few enthusiasts. Whitfield and the
Methodists made more money than disturbances;
his largest crop of proselytes lay among servant-maids;
and his warmest devotees went to Bedlam
without going to war. Bower, whom some thought
they had detected as a Jesuit, and who at most was
but detected as an impostor, had laid open the
practices of the Catholics, and detailed the establishments
of the Jesuits in the very heart of London,
without occasioning either alarm or murmur against
those fathers. His History of the Popes, one of the
ablest performances we have, was decried, because,
to recommend a work of truth and utility, he had
embroidered his own story with some marvellous
legends. Yet, uninflammable as the times were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
they carried a great mixture of superstition. Masquerades
had been abolished, because there had
been an earthquake at Lisbon; and when the last
jubilee-masquerade was exhibited at Ranelagh, the
ale-houses and roads to Chelsea were crowded with
drunken people, who assembled to denounce the
judgments of God on persons of fashion, whose
greatest sin was dressing themselves ridiculously.</p>

<p>A more inconvenient reformation, and not a more
sensible one, was set on foot by societies of tradesmen,
who denounced to the magistrate all bakers
that baked or sold bread on Sundays. Alum, and
the variety of spurious ingredients with which bread,
and indeed all wares, were adulterated all the week
round, gave not half so much offence as the vent
of the chief necessary of life on the seventh day.
Indecent prints were prohibited: the Chief-Justice
Mansfield caused to be seized at an auction a well-known
tale, called “The Woman of Pleasure,” a
work that simplified novels to their original intention.
Some of the elders, too, of our own Church,
seeing what harvests were brought into the tabernacles
of Whitfield and Wesley by familiarizing
God’s word to the vulgar, and by elevating vulgar
language, had the discretion to apply the same call
to their own lost sheep, and tinkled back their old
women by sounding the brass of the Methodists.
One Ashton, a quaint and fashionable preacher of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the Orthodox, talked to the people in a phrase compounded
of cant and politics: he reproved them for
not coming to church, where “<em>God keeps a day, but
sees little company</em>;” and informed them that “<em>our
ancestors loved powder and ball, and so did our
Generals; but the latter loved them for their hair
and hands</em>.” Yet to do justice to better principles,
the age had made some estimable improvements.
Prize-fighting, in which we had horribly resembled
the most barbarous and most polite nations, was
suppressed by the Legislature. Hogarth had undertaken
the cause of humanity, and painted satires
on all species of cruelty. From France and Italy,
we had adopted hospitals for foundlings; and from
the dictates of nature, all manner of hospitals. Our
stage grew chaste; indecency dared not to show its
face in a modern comedy, though it still remained
in possession of the old ones; and what is remarkable,
having been tolerated when women went to
the theatre in masks, preserved its hold, now they
went without them.</p>

<p>About this time, Lord Bute<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> obtained by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
means of Pitt the place of Commissioner of Excise
for Scott, the late Preceptor, to whom it had been
promised. It was even wrested from a young Pelham,
to whom Newcastle had actually given it.
Lord Bute thought this service to Scott necessary,
and had insisted warmly&mdash;otherwise Pitt shunned
all interfering in the disposal of employments.</p>

<p>The King, on the death of Princess Caroline, had
voluntarily promised to continue her allowance to
Princess Emily, who handsomely engaged to pay
the same pensions and the same grants to the prisons
that her sister Caroline had done. She had
even desired to impart a large portion of it to her
sister Mary of Hesse; but the King, while the
vapour of munificence lasted, said he should take
care of Mary. In a month’s time, the Duke of Newcastle
was sent in form to notify to Princess Emily
that the King retracted his promise, and should not
continue to her the allowance of Princess Caroline.</p>

<p>An affair was now opened, which having once
been deemed the most important point to English
liberty, would seem to demand large discussion.
But having been so much agitated formerly, and so
well explained in our parliamentary books, and now
ending without any alteration&mdash;rather without any
improvement, of the ancient system, I would willingly
be very brief in relating what passed. That
I mention it at all with any detail, when hastening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
to the conclusion of my work, is only to mark how
much the modes of thinking change, and that fundamentals
themselves can make no impression, if
apprehensions of arbitrary power are not in fashion.
If a passion for freedom is not in vogue, patriots
may sound the alarm till they are weary.</p>

<p>The Act of Habeas Corpus, by which prisoners
may insist on being brought to trial within a limited
time, is the corner-stone of our liberty. The power
of pressing, and some other cases, seemed to clash
with this invaluable privilege, or that with the
utility of pressing; for if soldiers or mariners, impressed
and carried to any distant quarters or ports,
might demand their <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas corpus</i>, and claim to
be brought to the capital to have it examined whether
they were properly subject to the violence laid
on them, sudden emergencies would be deprived of
their service, and a thousand accidents might happen
to facilitate their total escape, though ever so fit
for the intended destination of them. It was a
doubt, too, whether all the twelve Judges could or
were obliged to grant the writ in time of vacation.
These doubts, which many prudent men
thought it best to leave in suspense or overwhelm
in silence, others, if warmer, not worse-intentioned,
held necessary to be ascertained the moment they
had come into question: and they had come into
question, and a man, too apt to decide peremptorily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
when his decisions could strengthen prerogative,
had affected to pronounce against that universal
immunity from uncertain detention of their persons,
which the English, with so much reason, think their
birthright. This was the Chief Justice Mansfield.
He had a bitter antagonist in the Attorney-General
Pratt, who had not only entered into employment
on a popular foot, but personally hated the Chief
Justice, and was himself steady, warm, sullen,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
stained with no reproach, and an uniform Whig.
He declared himself with impetuosity for the utmost
latitude of the Habeas Corpus; and it reflected no
small honour on him, that the first advocate of the
Crown should appear the firmest champion against
prerogative. Nor should we deem less highly of
him, because private motives spurred him on to the
contest&mdash;alas! how cold would public virtue be, if
it never glowed but with public heat! So seldom,
too, it is that any considerations can bias a man to
run counter to the colour of his office and the interests
of his profession, that the world should not be
too scrupulous about accepting the service as a
merit, but should honour it at least for the sake of
the precedent.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>
<p>Pratt prepared a Bill for explaining and extending
the Habeas Corpus, and ascertaining its full operation.
It was brought into the House of Commons,
where Pitt and the Speaker supported it with firmness,
and the majority cheerfully promoted it. Yet
even in that House it met with avowed foes. The
authority of Lord Mansfield had weight with some;
the influence of Lord Hardwicke with more; and
the lawyers, who easily overlooked the essence of a
thing on which there was enough said in their books
to enchant them with sounds and cavils, laid themselves
out in such a profusion of jargon, that nothing
but the nonsense they talked prevented all the
world from seeing how much they contradicted
both themselves and one another. They made the
plainest thing in the world, <em>the right to freedom</em>,
the most obscure; and yet while any hope of their
becoming intelligible remained, men listened to
know through what genealogy of terms this blessing
had been derived to them: a common error that I
willingly censure, as if precedents brought in support
of, did not weaken liberty. Can ages of
ancestors submitting to tyranny impeach my freedom?
Have I not a right to be free the moment I
have the power of being so? If we hold our liberties
but by Magna Charta, we hold them by an
extorted piece of parchment. If the Crown had a
right to enslave us before, it has a right still, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
then that struggle was Rebellion; and what right
can Rebellion give? Magna Charta was but the
King’s confession of his usurpation; as taking up
arms against oppression is only doing justice on the
oppressor. I have ever found that such grave personages
as affect to authenticate our liberties by
history and precedent, are no better than those
foppish tools the Heralds, who hoard long rolls of
nobility, but are ready to forge a pedigree for the
first pretender to birth.</p>

<p>The Bill passed easily, though tediously, through
the Commons. Before I proceed to its fate among
the Lords, I must touch upon the other events of
the season.</p>

<p>The campaign was opened on our part with great
success. Prince Ferdinand and that gallant boy,
his nephew, drove the French out of Hanover, by a
plan, like that of Turenne in Alsace, of attacking
them in four different quarters at once. The Count
de Clermont, who had succeeded Richelieu, behaved
with a politeness that sufficiently indicated how
much the French were humbled;&mdash;he gave a pass
to a Courier, to come and acquaint the King that he
was again master of his dominions. But the virtuous
humanity of the Duc de Randan must not be confounded
with the humiliation of his countrymen:
Governor of Hanover, he had treated the conquered
with amiable lenity; and when he was obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
quit his post, and had full time to destroy his magazines,
he nobly abandoned them to the magistrates,
and marched himself the last out of the city, to
prevent his troops from committing any revengeful
outrage.</p>

<p>George Grenville took advantage of the triumphant
situation of his connexion, and renewed his
Navy Bill, which had been thrown out the last year.
And here Mr. Pitt had an opportunity of showing
that if he had submitted to unite with the very
men he had persecuted, the depression fell to them.
The Duke of Newcastle, Lord Hardwicke, and Lord
Anson were all obliged to vote for this very Bill,
which they had rejected last year. Some pretended
that this shifting conduct was but a compromise,
and that their intention of flinging out the new
Habeas Corpus was to be overlooked, in consideration
of their facilitating the Navy Bill; a bargain
about laws, not the more incredible for its being
shameful; and considering for what trifling acts
Mr. Pitt has stickled, while he acquiesced in the
loss of such an invaluable Bill, his patriotism will
lie under the suspicion of being more specious than
real. Lord Winchelsea, Lord Lyttelton, Lord
Marchmont, and the adherents of the Duke and
Fox, still opposed the Navy Bill; but it was carried
on the first division by 74 to 14. At the third
reading, Lord Bath spoke upon it,&mdash;a speech so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
miscellaneous and rambling, that it resembled his
ancient orations, except that in this he much commended
Sir Robert Walpole. Lord Denbigh attacked
Lord Marchmont, and said, he remembered when
that Lord had been connected with a man of very
different principles. Lord Marchmont, thinking
Lord Bolingbroke was the person alluded to, treated
his memory with great severity&mdash;though, by the way,
Lord Bolingbroke had died in friendship with him.
Lord Denbigh, without rising, said aloud, “He
mistakes; I meant Sir William Windham.” Marchmont
was disconcerted. The other, after the debate,
went up to Lord Hardwicke, and said, “Sir William
Windham put me under Lord Marchmont in
politics; and one day, in warm conversation, the
latter clapped his hand on my knee, and said,
‘Young man, remember I tell you, this country
will never be in a better situation while one of this
family is on the Throne.’” The Bill passed.</p>

<p>March 20th died Dr. Hutton, Archbishop of
Canterbury, after short possession of his see. The
Duke of Newcastle had great inclination to give it
to Dr. Hay Drummond, Bishop of St. Asaph, a
gentleman, a man of parts, and of the world; but
Lord Hardwicke’s influence carried it for Secker,
who certainly did not want parts or worldliness.</p>

<p>Lord George Sackville was now rising to a principal
figure. His abilities in the House of Commons
and his interest with Pitt gave him great weight in
Government, and everything seemed to promise
him the first rank in the Army, where, since the depression
of Conway, he stood without a rival. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Duke, who hated him, was removed; Marshal
Ligonier was very old, and was governed by him;
and by his seat in the Ordnance, and his own address,
he began to balance Fox in the direction of
the Duke of Marlborough. But his imperious temper
was not to be restrained; and at this very period
he wantonly started an enemy, under whose lash he
had reason afterwards to wish he had not fallen.</p>

<p>A considerable officer was Lord Tyrawley, too old
to give jealousy to Lord George, and who having
been neglected by the Duke of Newcastle, had
treated the latter with a contempt which, besides
his attaching himself to Fox, had assured an entire
stop to his own further advancement. Lord Tyrawley
had a thorough knowledge of the world, though less
of his own country than of others. He had long been
Minister in Portugal, where he grew into such
favour, that the late King, to keep him there, would
have appointed him his general. He had a great
deal of humour, and occasional good breeding, but
not to the prejudice of his natural temper, which
was imperiously blunt, haughty, and contemptuous,
with an undaunted portion of spirit. Accustomed
to the despotism of Portugal, Muscovy, and the
Army, he had little reverence for Parliaments, and
always spoke of them as the French do of the long-robe.
He even affected not to know where the
House of Commons was. He was just returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
from Gibraltar, where he had ordered great additions
to the works, with no more economy than
Governors are apt to do, who think themselves
above being responsible. Lord George Sackville
caught at this dissipation, and privately instigated
Sir John Philipps to censure the expense. To their
great surprise Lord Tyrawley demanded to be heard
at the bar of the House in his own defence. A
day was named. Lord Tyrawley drew up a memorial,
which he proposed to read to the House; and
which in the meantime he did read to everybody
else. It was conceived in bitter terms against
Lord George, and attacked him roundly on having
avoided all foreign command. This alarmed. Lord
George got the day of hearing adjourned for near a
fortnight; but Lord Tyrawley was not a man to
recede from his point; and Lord George having
underhand procured the report of Skinner, who
surveyed the works at Gibraltar to be brought
before the House, without mentioning what it was,
Mr. Fox laid open the unhandsome darkness of this
conduct, and Lord Tyrawley himself appeared at
the bar. As the hearing was before the Committee,
high words were avoided, which must have
ensued had the Speaker, who was not wont to
suffer disrespect to the House, been in the
chair; for Lord Tyrawley made good by his
behaviour all that had been taken for vapour before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
he appeared there. He treated the House with
great freedom, their forms with still greater; and
leaning on the bar (though he was allowed a chair),
he browbeat Skinner his censor, who stood on his
left hand, with such arrogant humour, that the
very lawyers thought themselves outdone in their
own style of worrying a culprit. He read his
memorial, which was well drawn and somewhat
softened, with great art and frankness, and assumed
more merit to himself than he had been charged
with blame. Such tough game tempted few hunters.
Lord George was glad to wave the sport;
and the House dismissed the affair with perfect satisfaction
in the innocence of a man who dared to do
wrong more than they dared to censure him.</p>

<p>Hitherto the King of Prussia had lain quiet.
Suspicions had even been entertained that he was
meditating or concluding a separate peace. At
last a new subsidiary treaty was concluded with
him, and Colonel Yorke was dispatched from the
Hague to fix that essential man. Luckily, Kniphausen
was on the road, with his assent to the
treaty, before Yorke arrived; otherwise the vainglory
of Lord Hardwicke could not have imagined
a more impolitic step for his country or his son.
Every attempt of our sending men of parts to circumvent
him had succeeded ill. The King of
Prussia was so far a little genius, that he dreaded
trying himself against talents. For this reason, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
used Legge and Sir Charles Williams in the most
ungracious manner. Lord Hyndford, Mr. Villiers,
and Mitchell, were the men that suited him&mdash;and
had he known him, he would not have feared
Yorke. But the King made Mitchell introduce
him, would talk to him on no business, and entertained
him with nothing but a panegyric on Mitchell.</p>

<p>The treaty was laid before the Houses, and
approved. Lord Denbigh commended it, and said,
he was glad the Elector of Hanover was included
in it, that he might not desert the King of England.
He entered a claim against any Hanoverian neutrality,
and rejoiced that we had another General;
censuring the Duke for the convention of Closter
Seven. This unjust bitterness was received with
marks of approbation by the Duke of Newcastle,
Lord Lincoln, and Lord Temple, and was ill retorted
by Lord Sandwich. Lord Lyttelton spoke well,
distinguishing between the two parts of the Administration,
and too ridiculously ascribing whatever
had been done well to the Duke of Newcastle.
Lord Temple answered him with vehement abuse,
and applied to him a passage out of Tully, which
Lord Lyttelton had formerly inscribed on a temple
at Stowe; the gentle conclusion of it was to call
him “Hominem detestabilem, imbecillum, caducum.”
Lord Lyttelton, as usual, replied with
firmness, but with too little asperity, considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
how unrelenting towards him was the malice of that
faction.</p>

<p>The grant of money for the treaty was followed
by the Ways and Means for the year. The new
taxes were laid on houses and windows, and on
places; a poor tribute to popularity offered by
Legge.</p>

<p>The Bill for explaining and extending the Act of
Habeas Corpus was now got into the House of
Lords, where it produced a new scene, and showed
how the feelings of men differ from their professions.
The constitution, as settled at present, is in a King
elected by the voice of the people, without any right
of succession, in opposition to an arbitrary family,
and tied down from acts of violence against the
liberty of individuals by that peculiar fundamental
law, the act of Habeas Corpus. The House of
Lords is the next branch of the Legislature. It is
composed of the ancient Peerage, who have expelled
their ancient Kings for the innovations of the latter,
and of modern Peers, created under the new establishment
by the favour of the Prince, or selected
from the sages of the Law for their integrity, wisdom,
and knowledge of the true rights of their
country. In this House, too, sit the Bishops,
who cannot be too tender of those laws, which
secure the exercise of their holy religion. In
this House sit the Cavendishes and Russels, renowned
for their vigorous defence of the Habeas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Corpus; and with them the Duke of Newcastle, the
ring-leader of the mob of Whigs on the accession
of the present family. The third estate is the
House of Commons.</p>

<p>Let us, before we pass to the discussion of the
Bill, anticipate the behaviour of all these persons
and bodies of men, all engaged by common interest
and common honour to support the charter, for
which they had violated other inferior ties; but
almost all swayed by private and separate interests
to abandon the cause. The King talked openly at
his Levee against the Bill; and it was understood
to be offensive to him to vote for the extension of
it. He was King; he did not desire to reduce the
prerogative lower than it had been delivered to
him. The Lords were become so much more considerable
than they had been before the Revolution,
that they were in no danger from the Crown; and
when they do not fear it, they will always be ready
to uphold it. They look on themselves as distinct
from the rest of the nation; and at best, leave the
people to be taken care of by their representatives,
the Commons. As jealous of, and as fond of their
privileges, as the King of his prerogative, they are
attentive to maintain them, and deem the rights of
the people rather encroachments than a common
interest. Added to this general description, they
were, at the time I write of, a tame, subservient,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
incapable set of men, governed entirely by the
Duke of Newcastle, and the two lawyers, Hardwicke
and Mansfield. Those lawyers were instances
of the discrimination that ought to be made between
the spirit of the laws and the profession of them.
Nobody better read in them, nobody more warm to
enforce them, nobody less actuated by the essence
of them. If either of them ever took the side
of liberty, or the side of mildness, I am willing
to be thought to asperse them. The conduct of the
Prelates had for so many years been so uniformly
supple, that no man expected anything from them
but complaisance for the Court&mdash;and they deceived
no man! The Hierarchy behaved so nobly in the
reign of James the Second, and has behaved so
poorly ever since, that they seem to know no medium
between a mitre and a crown of martyrdom. If
the clergy are not called to the latter, they never
deviate from the pursuit of the former. One
would think their motto was, <em>Canterbury or Smithfield</em>.</p>

<p>The heir of the house of Russel was silent, and
at last acquiesced in rejection of the Bill. His
compeer, the Duke of Devonshire, who did not love
Murray, and who had set out with approving the
Bill, became even an emissary to procure votes
against it. He wrote to Lord Hertford, to press
him to come to town and oppose it; and begged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
him, if he had any scruples, to come to him for the
clearing of them. A Cavendish soliciting against
the Habeas Corpus was a phenomenon; <em>that</em> Cavendish
supposing himself qualified for a casuist was
the height of burlesque. For the other Whig Duke,
Newcastle, he was the most pardonable of all.
There had not been an hour of his life that laid
him under the least obligation of acting consistently.
The House of Commons maintained
their character.</p>

<p>If this survey appears severe, let the motives be
considered and weighed. The Bill rejected was of
the most national concern; if rejected conscientiously,
the grounds were those of convenience preferred
to those of immutable right&mdash;and with what
arms do tyrants <em>begin</em> to combat liberty but with
those of necessity and convenience? But in the
present case I cannot allow conscience to the House
of Lords. The House of Commons,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> almost to a
man, approved the Bill. Five hundred men are
probably as conscientious as two hundred. But it
was evidently an affair of faction; and was rejected
in compliment to Lord Mansfield, to mark whom it
had been designed, and to gratify the private pique
and public authority of the family of Yorke, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
head of which always considered what was the law,
never on what grounds a law had been made.</p>

<p>On May 9th, the Bill was read by the Lords.
Lord Hardwicke, after chicaning upon it, rather than
attacking it openly, proposed to ask the opinions
of the Judges. Lord Temple answered him with
spirit, and reproached his Peers with being so long
governed by one Law Lord, now by two. He read
the strong introduction of the Earl of Devonshire
to the conference with the Commons on the former
Bill, and concluded with showing how improper it
was to take the opinions of the Judges, which must
be biassed, as the new Bill inflicted penalties on
them if they refused the writ. This drew on more
altercation between them, and much haughtiness
from Lord Hardwicke, who urged that it was an
improper time to press the Bill, when civil authority
wanted the utmost support: an argument that
suits the worst times and the worst Ministers; and
never advanced with less truth, for no man living
could say in what instance civil authority had
wanted assistance. Lord Granville spoke for the
Bill; but discovering afterwards how unwelcome it
was at St. James’s, he attended it no more. Lord
Mansfield opposed the Bill, and was seconded by
the Duke of Newcastle, who, though approaching
to seventy, still appeared in the full vigour of his
nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Chief Justice Willes, in the name of his
brethren, desired time to consider the question till
next term, as he himself was ill, and three of the
order were obliged to attend for three days at the
Old Bailey. But Lord Hardwicke, who the last
year would have detained Admirals under sailing
orders of the utmost consequence, affected to see
danger in this delay, in which by the nature of the
thing there could be no danger but in not giving
it sufficient deliberation, and was urgent that the
Judges should have but two days to consider the
point: so little decency did that man observe in
pursuing the dictates of his passions. But in this,
as in the former case, the House, with all its complaisance,
declined acquiescence, and allowed the
Judges above a fortnight. It was not expected
that Lord Hardwicke would have taken up the
point so strongly, as Lord Mansfield, whom he did
not love, was aimed at by the Bill; but Charles
Yorke, his son, who resented that Pratt was preferred
to him for Attorney-General, had declared
against the Bill, even without consulting his father.</p>

<p>The calling upon the Judges for their solemn
opinions was one of those dramatic exhibitions which
had twice before been played off by the Ministry
with success. No man supposed that Lord Hardwicke
or Lord Mansfield wished, wanted, or would
be directed by the sentiments of the rest, the subordinate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
part of the order: but the Bill was to be
thrown out, and the world to be amused by the
gravity of the oracles that were to pronounce against
it. The plan, I believe, in this, as in the former
cases, was Lord Mansfield’s. In his own and Stone’s
affair, the decorum of the Cabinet Council had made
prodigious impression. The Admirals, who were
rather struck with awe than inspired it, had served
to give a sort of colour to the fate of Mr. Byng&mdash;but
in the present instance this decoration of the
theatre did not terminate so advantageously. The
Cabinet Council had said little, but it was with
dignity: the Admirals less, but that was the very
thing desired. When the Judges came, they were
to talk, to talk on law, and to <em>explain</em> that law by
<em>jargon</em>. The field was so spacious and so inviting,
that they ran into all the subtleties, distinctions,
chicaneries, and absurdities of their profession.
They contradicted one another, and no two of them
but differed on some particular case. They exposed
themselves and their instigators, who at last could
not build upon any decision of those sages.</p>

<p>They began with Noel, the youngest Judge, a
pompous man, of little solidity. Wilmot, whose
manner was like Lord Mansfield’s, and very rapid
and full of fire, spoke warmly against the Bill,
though the intimate friend of Pratt and Legge. So
did Legge’s brother, the Judge, and Adams, another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
friend of Pratt. Wilmot and Noel differed in some
points of not much moment. The former spoke
with great applause, though too diffusely. Bathurst
was strong against Wilmot; Smyth with him.
Foster could not attend, being hindered by the
illness of his wife; but he was zealous for the Bill,
and published a large pamphlet in support of it.
The rest were discordant and inconclusive; and so
little was gained by the delivery of their opinions,
that Lord Temple now pleaded for the Bill on the
disagreement of the Judges; and moved a long
question, the purport of which was, that an affidavit
of confinement ought to be a probable cause for the
Judges to grant the writ. Lord Lyttelton saying,
that in any other place that question would be a
defamatory libel on the Judges, Lord Temple started
up and said, “This is impertinence I will not bear.”&mdash;This
occasioned much confusion. Lord Lyttelton
explained himself handsomely, saying he had applied
words to words, not to persons: he was sorry if he
had given offence; he had meant less offence to
Lord Temple than to anybody: he revered the
manes of their former friendship; he hoped the
ashes were not extinguished past return. To all
this Lord Temple said nothing; and when the
House insisted on their giving their words that it
should proceed no further, Lord Temple sullenly
endeavoured to avoid it by shifting the asking of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
pardon on Lord Lyttelton. The latter engaged
with frankness to drop it&mdash;always the most sensible
way when words have passed in public, which are
sure of being prevented from further discussion.
Lord Lyttelton was known to want no spirit: Lord
Temple had been miserably deficient.</p>

<p>The fate of the Bill, which could not be procured
by the sanction of the Judges, Lord Mansfield was
forced to take on himself. He spoke for two hours
and half: his voice and manner, composed of harmonious
solemnity, were the least graces of his
speech. I am not averse to own that I never heard
so much argument, so much sense, so much oratory
united. His deviations into the abstruse minutiæ
of the Law served but as a foil to the luminous parts
of the oration. Perhaps it was the only speech
that, in my time at least, had real effect; that is,
convinced many persons. Nor did I ever know how
true a votary I was to liberty till I found that I
was not one of the number staggered by that speech.
I took as many notes of it as I possibly could; and
prolix as they would be, I would give them to the
reader, if it would not be injustice to Lord Mansfield
to curtail and mangle, as I should by the want
of connexion, so beautiful a thread of argumentation.</p>

<p>Lord Temple made a feeble answer&mdash;yet the force
of truth was still so great, that notwithstanding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
visible operation of Lord Mansfield’s speech, they
would not venture directly to reject the Bill. Lord
Hardwicke agreed that all the Judges ought to have
equal power in granting the writ, and said that he
would move to order the Judges to bring in such a
Bill against the next session. Lord Temple’s friends
seemed glad to catch at this proposal; and the Bill
was heard of no more!<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The complexion of the rest of the year was military.
Even the softest penetralia of the Court were
threatened with storms. The Princess began to
perceive an alteration in the ardour of Lord Bute,
which grew less assiduous about her and increased
towards her son. The Earl had attained such an
ascendant over the Prince, that he became more
remiss to the mother: and no doubt it was an easier
function to lead the understanding of a youth, than
to keep up to the spirit required by an experienced
woman. The Prince even dropped hints against
women interfering in politics. These clouds, however,
did not burst; and the creatures of the Princess
vindicated her from any breach with Lord Bute
with as much earnestness as if their union had been
to her honour.</p>

<p>The King of Prussia opened one of his ablest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
campaigns. The same enemies still crowded upon
him, though much of their vigour was abated by
the extraordinary efforts they had made to overwhelm
him: yet obliging him to make head against
so many Armies, his fall at last seemed inevitable.
Sweden, involved in domestic broils, rather kept up
his attention, and divided his forces, than hurt him
actively. The unwieldy numbers of Muscovites
again advanced. The Czarina, inflexible in resentments,
which she did not attend enough to the
operations of government to enforce properly, had
thought herself betrayed. Apraxin was recalled;
the great Chancellor Bestucheff, inclined to England,
was disgraced, and new Generals commissioned to
execute her vengeance. The Empress-Queen had
drained her own and her husband’s dominions to
collect a decisive force: yet the vivacity of the
King of Prussia, instead of entrenching wholly on
the defensive, though he disposed various Armies to
keep the Russians at bay and to cover Saxony, led
him to a hardy step: after besieging and taking
Schweidnitz in thirteen days, he instantaneously
appeared in Moravia, the short road to Vienna.
Daun had thought him preparing to attack Bohemia,
when, to his surprise, he heard the King had
opened the siege of Olmutz. On this theatre the
alert Monarch and the cautious Marshal displayed
all the resources of their art, and by the opposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of their characters, and the balance of their talents,
showed each other in every light that could create
admiration.</p>

<p>But this is a theme, beyond my flight:&mdash;suffice it
to say, that Daun repaired his oversight by cutting
off the King’s convoys, and reducing him to raise
the siege; and the King converted this check into
new matter of glory, by suddenly starting from
Daun, getting a march of two days, and piercing
into Bohemia, where he made himself master of
Konigsgratz, while Daun did not suspect that he
had driven him from a siege to a conquest. In
fact, it was not Daun alone that rescued Olmutz
and saved Vienna: the Russians were pouring upon
Brandenburgh, not more formidable by their designs
than by their dreadful manner of executing them.
Savage cruelty and devastation attended their march.
They besieged Custrin with unspeakable fury, and
reduced the brave Governor to defend a mountain
of ashes and a few ruinous walls&mdash;the next step was
Berlin. But I am advanced too far into the year,
and must look back to other operations.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt, no less enterprising than Frederick, but
a little less informed, and a good deal less disposed
to listen to information, determined to strike some
mighty stroke on his part, that might combine his
name with the glory of that King, and cement and
justify their harmony. Unfortunately, his mind was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
not purged of its vision of Rochfort, and he again
chose the coast of France for the scene of his romance.
A strong fleet was equipped of eighteen ships of the
line, thirteen frigates, three sloops, four fire-ships,
and two bomb-ketches, and carrying an Army of
fourteen thousand landmen and six thousand marines.
The Duke of Marlborough, on whom Lord
George Sackville could not avoid attending, was
appointed General. Commodore Howe was destined
to lead the Fleet: on which Sir Edward Hawke
struck his flag; but being persuaded to resume it,
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'accompained Lord Anson'">accompanied Lord Anson</ins>, who took the command
himself. The mode of volunteers, which the Duke
had always discouraged, now revived: Sir James
Lowther, master of 40,000<em>l.</em> a year, Lord Downe,
Sir John Armitage, and others, embarked with the
expedition. Lord Granby at the same time came
into the service, and was appointed Colonel of the
Blues; and George Townshend, now there was no
more question of the Duke, returned to the Army,
and was restored on the foot of his former rank.
The armament sailed on the first of June. Lord
Anson, with the larger ships, kept out at sea; Howe
led the transports, which for some days were kept
back by contrary winds, but anchored on the fifth
in Cancalle-bay, near St. Maloes. The troops
landed without opposition; when the Commanders
(as in former expeditions) seeming dispatched, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
scanty was their intelligence, to <em>discover</em> the coast
of France, rather than to master it, soon perceived
that the town was so strongly situated, and approachable
only by a narrow causeway, that, after
burning a parcel<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> of small vessels, they returned to
their ships; and the French learned that they were
not to be conquered by every Duke of Marlborough.</p>

<p>The Duke himself was personally brave, and was
eager to land on the first possibility; but he had
neither experience nor information, nor probability
on his side adequate to such a bravado. However,
it was well for him that his miscarriage happened
under the auspices of Pitt, not of Fox. Here, it was
said, his Grace and his troops remarked that Lord
George Sackville was not among the first to court
danger: and Howe, who never made friendship but
at the mouth of a cannon, had conceived and expressed
a strong aversion to him.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> It is certain
that both the Duke and Lord George were so sick
of naval expeditions, that, after parading before
Granvelle and Cherbourg, they returned with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>Fleet to St. Helen’s, and set out for the Army in
Germany, where the Duke took the command of
the English forces. General Blighe had been
fetched from Ireland on that intent, but was obliged
to cede to the superior influence of Marlborough;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
and more cruelly was appointed to resume the
thread of our silly expeditions, from which Mr.
Pitt and the mob still expected I don’t know what of
glory. Blighe was an elderly man, of no talents,
brave, but in every other shape unfit for the
destined service, supposing there was such a thing
as fitness for that service. The armament sailed
again, and Prince Edward embarked with them:
and that some utility might at least be pretended
from this vain expense, Prince Ferdinand, to flatter
Pitt, wrote letter after letter to declare the great
benefits he reaped from our expeditions, by which the
attention and troops of France were divided: an
affirmation of so little truth, that the Duke of
Marlborough, in the hurry of their retreat, having
left his silver tea-spoons behind him, the Duc
d’Aiguillon, politely to mark contempt, sent them
home by a cartel-ship.</p>

<p>But Prince Ferdinand who thus complimented
the English Ministry on the wisdom of these idle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
measures, showed it was not from want of knowing
how to perform realities. Having pushed the
French beyond the Rhine, he passed it himself at
Herven in sight of their whole Army, and soon
eclipsed the glory of that passage by defeating them
at Crevelt, where they lost seven thousand men,
and the Duc de Gisors, the only son of Marshal
Belleisle, an amiable and accomplished young
man. The <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'King bad Knyphausen'">King had Knyphausen</ins> thank the King
of Prussia for giving him so able a General. The
Princess Gouvernante wrote to Prince Ferdinand to
complain of his passing over part of the territories
of the States. He replied, “He was sorry; it had
been over a very small part, and he should not
have violated even that, had he had the same
Dutch guides that led the French to Hanover in
the preceding year.”</p>

<p>The French were commanded by the Count de
Clermont, a Prince of the Blood of no estimation:
their discipline was so bad, that two-and-fifty officers
went to amuse themselves at Paris without leave of
the Court. D’Etrées, their best General, had been
recalled by the intrigues of Madame Pompadour and
her faction, whose interest was displayed in a remarkable
instance. At a meeting of the Marshals of
France, D’Etrées complained of a libel written against
him, which he produced. Maillebois, attached to the
mistress, said, “It would be right for the honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of the corps to have it inquired into; and the more
so, because he believed the charge was well-grounded,
as he had been informed by his son, who wrote the
pamphlet.” The declaration was frank: Maillebois
was banished, and his son chastised but gently;
and indemnification was soon procured for both.</p>

<p>The victory of Crevelt did not draw on the consequences
that were expected. Contades, the
fourth commander despatched into Germany by the
fluctuating councils at Versailles, found employment
for Prince Ferdinand without risking another
battle; and the Duc de Broglio and the Prince de
Soubise attacked and cut to pieces seven thousand
Hessians under the Prince of Ysenberg; and would,
it was feared, intercept the English troops under
the Duke of Marlborough, who landed at Embden.
This became more probable, as Monsieur Chevert
formed a plan to burn one of Prince Ferdinand’s
bridges and to seize his magazines, and cut off
Baron Imhoff, who was posted to secure the passage
of the Rhine. But Imhoff, who soon perceived his
own desperate situation, destroyed this well-concerted
scheme, which failed by its very approach to
success; for Imhoff would not stay to be surrounded,
but with his little force attacked Chevert (who
commanded twelve thousand men) and dispersed
them in less than half an hour, taking eleven pieces
of cannon, their baggage, and a great number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
prisoners. Chevert was one of the ablest officers in
the French service; Imhoff, a man of so little capacity,
that the talents of his life seemed to have been
reserved for this sole occasion. The junction with
the English was made, and Prince Ferdinand
repassed the Rhine unmolested.</p>

<p>During these operations, the Parliament of England
rose; and nothing worth notice happened but
the conviction of Dr. Hensey, a poor physician, who
had been taken up in the preceding year for a
treasonable correspondence. It appeared that he
was a pensioner of France, who gave him but an
hundred a year, and thought it too much; threatening,
in answer to his repeated solicitations of invasion,
that they would withdraw their allowance,
unless he found means of giving them more material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
intelligence. The threat had such effect, that
he gave them the first notice of the design on Rochfort.
How he obtained it I know not; but his
close connexion with D’Abreu, the Spanish Resident,
whose physician he was, and who visited him often
in prison, and obtained his pardon on the very
morning that he was going to execution, made it
probable that he was only a tool of that Minister,
known to wish ill to England.</p>

<p>The election of a Pope drew a momentary
attention to Rome, which did not use to be forgotten
because Europe was embroiled. Benedict
XIV. was dead. Thirty-four Cardinals wished to
raise Cardinal Cavalchini to the Tiara: but he
was disagreeable to the Court of France, which
endeavoured to deal with the Holy Ghost in the
more decent way of intrigue, to prevent his exaltation.
Lanti, who had several benefices in France,
was admonished not to vote for him; but Lanti
was his intimate friend, and had the promise of
being Secretary of State. France applied, too,
to the Cardinal of York, on whom they had
lately bestowed rich Abbeys: but his obstinacy
always found out some virtue to justify itself;
and when they pressed his father to dissuade him
from voting for Cavalchini, young Stuart replied,
“He had rather lose his head than violate his
conscience.” For twenty-four hours, Cavalchini’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
party was inflexible. The French Cardinals endeavoured
to get the nomination put off till the
arrival of the German Cardinal Roolt, who was
supposed to have the secret of the Court of
Vienna: but all was in vain. The declaration
was fixed; when the Cardinal de Luynes, finding
no temperate measures would have any effect,
produced a formal exclusion of Cavalchini. It
occasioned great amazement and disgust. Of
late years, no such step had been practised. The
friends of Cavalchini let him for one night enjoy
the dream of empire: it was not till next morning
that his friend Lanti went to his cell and
announced the fatal veto. However he received
the stroke in private, his public answer was sensible:
he thanked the Court of France for saving
him from the tremendous station of being God’s
Vicar upon earth. The ostensible reason of his
exclusion was his attachment to the King of Sardinia;
the true one, his being devoted to the
Jesuits. In the critical situation of religious
affairs in France, it was not thought proper to
throw the weight of the Court of Rome into the
scale of those fathers, and to suffer at the head of
the Church a man who had written strongly in
favour of the canonization of Cardinal Bellarmine.
It was said, that the same exclusion would have
been urged against Cardinal Durini, had he appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
on the lists before Cavalchini. Durini’s
crime was of a less public nature, but not a more
remissible one: when Nuncio in France, he had
refused to visit Madame Pompadour.</p>

<p>Rezzonico, a simple Venetian bigot, not at all less
addicted to the Jesuits than Cavalchini, ascended
the Papal Chair. The revolution of affairs was
singular; the state of Venice had been on the
point, just when the late Pope died, of incurring
the penalty of excommunication for disobedience to
the Holy See.</p>

<p>The English Fleet had again sailed from St.
Helen’s to attack the French coast. Prince Edward
went on board Mr. Howe’s ship, and General
Blighe led the land forces. They soon anchored
before Cherbourg, landed, and the next day without
opposition entered the town. There they destroyed
the bason formed at great expense, burned some
small vessels, and brought away the brass cannon
and mortars, which were reposed for some days in
Hyde Park, to the high amusement of the populace,
and then with equal ostentation drawn through the
City and deposited at the Tower. But the news of
a much more considerable conquest arrived at the
same time: Cape Breton was again fallen under
the power of England. Admiral Boscawen and
General Amherst, with a Fleet of one hundred and
fifty sail and fourteen thousand men, had appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
before Louisbourg on the 2nd of June, and by the
end of July made themselves masters of the place,
after destroying or taking five men-of-war that lay
to cover it. The bravery of the English and the
want of spirit in the French never appeared in
greater opposition: the former making their attacks
on spots which the French deemed impregnable,
threw them into utter dismay; and dictated very
quick and unjustifiable submission. Boscawen’s
rough courage was fully known before; Amherst
was a cool, sensible man, whose conduct, now first
experienced in command, shone to great advantage;
and the activity of spirit in Wolfe, who accompanied
him, contributed signally to the reduction of
the place. The colours taken there were carried
with great parade to St. Paul’s.</p>

<p>The other operations in America were not equally
successful. Lord Howe was killed in a skirmish, in
which he gained the advantage, as the Army was
marching against Ticonderoga; before which place
Abercrombie was defeated with the loss of two
thousand men, and from whence he made a precipitate
retreat. Colonel Bradstreet, however, took
Fort Frontenac; and General Forbes, Fort Duquesne.
The French, indeed, behaved ill everywhere.
The ambitious plans of their Government,
their perfidious breach of treaties, and their airs of
superiority, were not at all supported by genius in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
their Ministers, conduct in their officers, or bravery
in their troops. The most remarkable advantage
they obtained against us was in an affair, in which,
though the bravery of our officers and troops was
gallant and firm beyond expectation, yet there certainly
appeared neither genius in the Ministers who
directed, nor conduct in the Commanders who were
entrusted with the execution&mdash;if I may use the
term execution&mdash;of an affair, in which there was
neither plan nor common sense. This was the unhappy
action at St. Cas.</p>

<p>The Fleet, after leaving Cherbourg, hovered about
the coast of France; and at last the troops were
landed on the other side of St. Maloes, in the bay
St. Lunaire. The new Lord Howe contented himself
with setting them on shore; and the weather
proving very tempestuous, he left them there, with
directions to come to him at St. Cas by land. What
he left them there to do, or why General Blighe
suffered himself to be left there, no man living
could ever tell or guess. The troops, as if landed
on some new-discovered coast of America, roved
about the country for some days, even without artillery,
till they heard that the Duc d’Aiguillon, with
a considerable force, was within a few miles. A
retreat to the ships was immediately ordered. The
French advanced, but keeping at a distance till
their prey was sure. Our troops were to descend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the rocks; among which they were no sooner embarrassed,
than the French appeared on the rising
grounds above them; and before the Grenadier
Guards, who made the last stand to cover the embarkation,
could get on board, the French fell on
them in a hollow way, and made a dreadful slaughter.
Yet the intrepidity of the soldiers and of the young
officers of the Guards was displayed in the most
heroic manner&mdash;but in vain: many of the latter
fell. General Dury was shot, and fell into the sea.
Sir John Armitage, a young volunteer of fortune,
was lost, and several officers of quality and figure
were made prisoners. The folly of this exploit,
the inhumanity of exposing gallant men to carnage
for no end imaginable but to satisfy the obstinate
ostentation of a Minister, who was as much determined
to do something as he was really determined
to do well, was contrasted, with great severity, on
our nation, by the tender attentions, politeness, and
good-nature of the Duc d’Aiguillon, who spared his
victims the moment he dared to spare, and comforted
and relieved the prisoners and wounded, as
if he had been their own Commander. Such was
the conclusion of Mr. Pitt’s invasions of France, the
idleness or fruitlessness of which took off from the
judgment of his other attempts and successes;
though, while this country exists in independence,
not even his own ambition, which prompted his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
attempts, can detract from the merit of his undertaking,
retrieving, re-establishing, the affairs of
Britain.</p>

<p>General Blighe, the passive tool in this Quixotism,
was the only sufferer after their return. He was so
ill received, that he found it necessary to resign his
regiment and government, and saw himself undone
by being sent, when a veteran officer of Horse, to
command a naval expedition. He had been actuated,
during the course of these enterprises, by a
young Lord Fitz-morrice and the adventurer Clarke,
who diverted himself from the ships with the difficulties
his comrades found in re-embarking. But
he was on the point of falling under the punishment
due to his arrogance: depending on his interest in
the General, he had broken the arrest under which
he had been put, for some misdemeanour, by Cunningham,
his commanding officer; the same Cunningham,
whose handsome behaviour at Minorca I
have mentioned: at his return from thence he had
been preferred by the Duke, who told him he had
been misinformed of his character, and was sorry
he had not sooner known his merit. At their return
from St. Cas, Cunningham insisted on bringing
Clarke before a Court-Martial. The Princess
unwisely countenanced the latter, who had made
himself odious to the Army, and who escaped;
Cunningham being suddenly ordered on the expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
to Martinico and Guadaloupe, at the latter
of which places he unfortunately died, when his
services were in the fairest train of being rewarded.</p>

<p>We left the King of Prussia in apprehension of
seeing his own dominions become the theatre of
war. To detail his actions would destroy the idea
of their rapidity. He had flown from the siege of
Olmutz to invade Bohemia, attacking his enemies
everywhere, while his Generals could scarce preserve
themselves on the defensive. Dohna was
watching the Russians rather than opposing them:
Manteuffel could scarce make a firmer stand even
against the Swedes. Prince Henry was threatened
as he covered Dresden. The King, always present
where the nearest danger pressed, appeared before
the ruined walls of Custrin, gave battle to the
Russians, and after a bloody contention from nine
in the morning till seven at night, obliged that
savage and undaunted people to retire. Above
twenty thousand had fallen,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> yet slaughter seemed
to inspire them with fierceness rather than with
dismay; when obliged at last to avoid a butchery
which they had tempted rather than repelled, they
retired in good order, and even claimed the honour
of the day. The trifling loss suffered by the King’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
troops, and the consequences of the victory, which
delivered him from those barbarians for that campaign,
contented a Prince who had been forced
into a hero, and who knew that many such successes
were necessary before he could lay aside the
sword. He left Dohna to adjust the controversy of
victory, and marched to the relief of his brother.
He accomplished it by joining him, and Daun retired.
The Swedes marched back with precipitation
on the defeat of the Muscovites.</p>

<p>About this time we were on the point of a rupture
with Holland. That country was sunk in
power and reputation, laboured with debts and
factions, was influenced by no genius, and had lost
all military spirit. In such a situation, no wonder
they were not desirous of again beholding the
Armies of their neighbour King on the frontiers of
Flanders; the only spot where those universal
aspirers, the French, know how to shine. Animated
by no zeal of a common cause, the Dutch,
who were determined not to engage on our side,
thought the second step of prudence was to profit
of our calamities. The States winked commercially
at supplies furnished by their merchants to the
French colonies, and a little more than commercially,
transported,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> not only their commodities, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
military stores. Our privateers, as apt to infringe
treaties as the wisest Burgomaster, and who distinguished
between friendship and enmity by no rule
but that which constituted contraband goods, made
very free with the ships of our friends employed by
our enemies. Those friends complained with as
little modesty as if they had acted like friends: we
replied with firmness, and advised them to avoid
giving provocation. They grew more violent, without
growing more impartial. Their ships were
condemned as legal captures. Their merchants
presented remonstrance after remonstrance to the
Princess Gouvernante, pressing her to proceed to
more open declarations. She, who knew that
clamour was not power but in its own country,
told them she would not declare, unless they would
augment their forces.</p>

<p>The Dutch endeavoured to draw Spain and Denmark,
who had suffered in the same manner from
the same causes, though in a less degree, into an
association against what they called our piracies.
The Princess was dying: it was apprehended that
her death would let loose all the interested fury of
the Dutch traders. The Duke of Newcastle ordered
Mr. Yorke to make strong promises of satisfaction
to Holland: this was without communicating with
Mr. Pitt; who receiving duplicates of complaints,
empowered Mr. Yorke to give assurances of much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
fainter complexion. Mr. Yorke answered, that
was now too late; he had been commissioned to
give, and had accordingly given encouragement to
hope for fuller redress. Pitt, with becoming warmth,
expostulated with Newcastle, and bade him get out
of the scrape as he could. More of this dispute
will appear hereafter.</p>

<p>While Europe was attending to the scenes of
blood exhibited by most of its formidable powers,
its attention was called off by an event very foreign
to those struggles. An attempt of assassination
was made on the person of the King of Portugal.
One night, as he was returning in his chaise,
with very few attendants, from an affair of gallantry,
he was attacked and shot through the arm: the
assassins thought their work completed. The King
was not wounded mortally, and recovered in a few
weeks. The Court’s ignorance of the murderers,
and of the cause of the blow, prompted them to
endeavour to conceal the fact. Their Ministers in
foreign Courts were ordered to give out that the
King had had a fall in his palace, had hurt his arm,
and that during his incapacity of signing papers,
the Queen would assume the reins of Government.
A tale too ill-concerted, not to divulge the secret,
supposing the assassination of a King could have
remained a secret. Yet the notoriety of the fact
led the public to no light into it. Revenge was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
undoubtedly the groundwork: but whether the
revenge of an injured husband, of a dishonoured
house, or of more holy murderers, all the curiosity
of the public could not ascertain.</p>

<p>The lady, supposed in question, was of illustrious
blood&mdash;yet, jealous and vindictive as Portuguese
and Spaniards are, they seldom carry their delicacy
of honour so high as to think the wound irreparable,
if given by their Sovereign. But there was another
order of men, on whose ideas the generality reasoned
differently: an order not so scrupulous about
receiving affronts, or of returning injuries, where
more essential interests than their honour is concerned.
These were the Jesuits: they had long
assumed dominion over Paraguay, and had established
an economy of government there, which,
while it ensured their authority by endearing them
to the governed, almost made amends, by the felicity
they established among the people of that province,
for the numberless mischiefs they have brought
on other countries. In short, the Jesuits alone indemnified
the Americans of that region for the loss of
their liberty, and atoned for some of the cruelties
exercised by European conquerors. But the good
fathers were not content with dispensing blessings
as proxies for others: the Paraguayans must own
their sceptre as well as their beneficence.</p>

<p>I do not pretend to pierce the mysterious veil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
thrown over the transactions of that country, nor
to assert the tale of their actually crowning one of
their order. It is sufficient to say that the Court
of Lisbon had entertained the strongest jealousy of
their proceedings; had determined to break the
charm by which they excluded their own Sovereign
from interfering in his own domain; and had
actually engaged that upright Pontiff, Benedict XIV.,
to discountenance their ambitious proceedings.
The fathers even apprehended severe decrees from
the Vatican. At that crisis the life of the King of
Portugal was attempted&mdash;no wonder the Jesuits
were suspected.</p>

<p>The Court of Lisbon, which in its confusion had
formed so improbable a story to account for the disappearance
of the King, did not act by any means,
in its subsequent proceedings, with equal inconsideration.
The consequences of this affair ran
into the following year; but being totally unconnected
with every transaction that I propose to
relate, I shall throw the whole of this Portuguese
history into this place. The first Minister was Carvalho,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
a bold, politic man, who hated the Jesuits.
For some months the Court observed a total silence:
nobody was apprehended, no suspicion discovered.
Till Carvalho had got a clue that led to the darkest
recesses of the mystery, it was affected to forget or
treat the whole as an accident of a private nature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
How he wound himself into the secret I do not pretend
to say: there were many accounts, probably
mere conjectures: it is an anecdote never likely to
be known. The first notification to the public that
the conspiracy was discovered, was made by seizing
at the same instant, at a ball, the whole families of
Tavora and Aveiro, houses of the first rank and
noblest birth in Portugal, and the chiefs of which
were possessed of the greatest posts and employments
about the King. To them, till assembled in
the snare, the King wore a face of the most unsuspecting
favour.</p>

<p>The Marchioness of Tavora was a woman of fierce
and lofty spirit; one of the married young ladies,
the person beloved by the King. And hence the
whole dark plot was unravelled; and the two different
conjectures of the public on the cause of the
assassination appeared to have been both true, for
they were combined together. The Jesuits had
worked on the pride and jealousy of the injured
husband and his house, till those rash noblemen
thought to revenge themselves, while they only acted
the revenge of the Jesuits. Enough was confessed
to establish the guilt of both the one and the other.
How far the plot was spread, and how far its views
extended, perhaps the conspirators themselves knew
not: whatever they discovered beyond their actual
guilt, and the participation of the Jesuits, was locked
up in the penetralia of the palace. The public learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
enough in knowing the latter; perhaps too much
in seeing the dreadful executions of several of the
principal conspirators, and in <em>not</em> seeing some justice
done on the most guilty, the instigators of the
crime. The old Marchioness was beheaded, and
died with as heroic spirit as if she suffered for her
country. Her husband and son-in-law suffered the
most exquisite torments. A hapless youth, her son,
shared her fate, with others of his house. One of
the actual assassins, a hired bravo, or servant, was
put to extreme torture. All the Jesuits and their
effects were seized, and their persons imprisoned,
while leave was demanded from Rome to punish
them in a more exemplary manner. But there the
strong sense of Benedict was no longer on the
throne&mdash;and an absolute Prince, wounded by the
practices of priests, did not dare to proceed to
extremities. The dress of religion guarded men,
the more guilty for violating the duties of their profession.
As the Pope’s permission to inflict capital
punishments could not be obtained, the Court of
Lisbon took upon itself to embark the whole order
of Jesuits, and sent them to Rome to the patron of
their crimes; reserving only a few of the most
guilty, whose fate is still a secret.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>
<p>I cannot quit this subject without taking notice
of the manifesto issued by the Court on the detection
of the conspiracy. The spirit of despotic government
never defined itself with so much truth, or
with less modesty, than in that singular piece: I
say nothing of the ridiculous bombast in which it
is clothed; but the following maxims of an arbitrary
Court ought to be inscribed in our seats of Legislature
and of Law, by the side of the humane rules
of our Government, that we might know how justly
to value the one, and avoid whatever tends to approach
it to the other. “Whereas,” says the Portuguese
manifesto, “all presumptions of the law are
held for so many every way unquestionable truths,
and for so many full and uncontrovertible proofs,
and lay the person who has them against him, under
the incumbency of producing other contrary proofs
of such strength and efficacy, as may conclusively
destroy them, &amp;c.;” and the next paragraph adds,
“Whereas, the law presumes, that he who has been
once bad, will be always bad in crimes of the same
species with that he has already committed, &amp;c.”
Could one imagine that two assertions, so repugnant
to all ideas of justice, were produced as instances
of condescension and moderation? and yet, in the
beginning of the first of these paragraphs, it is
maintained, that the presumptions of the law, which
condemn the ringleaders or heads of the said conspiracy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
to be punished thereby with all the rigours
of the law, would amply suffice, without the proofs
which the Court had obtained. Are Lisbon and
London so distant as these notions, and our establishment
of juries, and the methods by which the
latter are bound to proceed?</p>

<p>While our Army in Germany lay on the defensive,
the fatal distempers incident to a camp raged there,
and in particular carried off the Duke of Marlborough.
The command of the English devolved on
Lord George Sackville, between whom and Prince
Ferdinand there was by no means any cordiality.
Both liked to govern, neither was disposed to be
governed. Prince Ferdinand had gained an ascendant
over the Duke of Marlborough, and Lord
George had lost it; sufficient groundwork for their
enmity. Lord Granby, the next in rank to Lord
George, was an honest, open-hearted young man,
of undaunted spirit, and no capacity; and if he
wanted any other recommendation to Prince Ferdinand
besides these ductile qualities, he drank as
profusely as a German. Lord George’s haughtiness
lost this young man, as he had the Duke of Marlborough;
Prince Ferdinand knew better how to
bend in order to domineer.</p>

<p>In the mean time the King of Prussia, who had
performed such shining actions in this campaign,
was again reminded by Marshal Daun, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
solid glory of generalship, if not the brilliancy,
might be disputed with him. As the King lay in
the strong camp of Bautzen, extending to Hochkirchen,
covering, as he thought, Misnia, Lusatia,
and Brandenburgh, preserving a communication with
his brother, and at hand to throw succours into
Silesia, Daun, marching in the dead of the night,
surprised his right wing, and the first notice of the
attack was given in the heart of the Prussian camp.
There fell Marshal Keith; and Prince Francis of
Brunswick, mounting his horse on the first alarm,
lost his head by a cannon ball. In this critical
moment the King possessed himself, that is, coolness
and ardour: he flew to the thick of the contest,
and after leading on his troops four times to the
most desperate service, retreated in good order.
He lost 7000 men, but scarce any ground or reputation.
Surprised in the night, he behaved with as
much conduct as if he had made the assault, and
retired from the conflict as if only from a disappointment.
Twice now had he been defeated by Marshal
Daun; both times he appeared greater from his activity
and resources. It was still more extraordinary
when, after his loss at Hochkirchen, he acted in the
style of conqueror. He prevented Daun from penetrating
into Silesia, and hastened into that province
himself, where Neiss and Cosel were besieged by
the Austrian Generals Harsch and Deville. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
King’s approach, both sieges were instantly raised.
Daun, the check and illustrator of Frederick’s glory,
who, by beating the King, had only precipitated
his succour of his own dominions, had no choice
left, but to attack Dresden. He led a great army
to besiege it, but Schmettau, the Governor, having
burned the suburbs and retired into the city, before
Daun could begin any regular operations against the
place, the King of Prussia was returned from his successes
in Silesia, and concluded the campaign with
obliging his conqueror to abandon Dresden. After
this the several Armies went into winter quarters.</p>

<p>Nov. 23rd the Parliament met. Pitt opened the
business of the session with art, seeming to avoid
all ostentation of power, while he assumed everything
to himself but the disposition of the
money. That load he left on the Treasury,
and vast, he said, it would be: heaps of millions
must be raised,&mdash;thus affecting to heighten rather
than disguise the expense and the difficulties of our
situation; we could not make the same war as the
French, or as our ancestors did, for the same money.
He painted the distress of France, and coloured
high what had been done by ourselves. He called
on any who disapproved the measures taken or
taking, to speak out, to discuss them, or to propose
others <em>then</em>; not to lie in wait in hopes of distresses,
and then find fault; though, for himself, he hoped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
he should never be judged by events. If there
were any secret Austrians in the House, instead of
dispersing pamphlets, he invited them to speak out.
This was particularly levelled at Doddington, who
had just published severe reflections on Pitt and the
Prussian cause, in a piece called, “Examination
of a Letter, attributed to General Blighe.” The
Addresses of both Houses were couched in strong
terms of panegyric. Prince Ferdinand was commended
by name; and Sir Richard Grosvenor, a young
converted Tory, who seconded the Address, called
Mr. Pitt a blazing star. Other thanks were moved
and voted to Admiral Boscawen and General Amherst,
for the conquest of Cape Breton, of which
Sir John Philips said, he hoped no Ministry would
ever rob us. Beckford re-echoed this, and spoke
on the superiority we had now attained: all the
Duke of Marlborough’s battles had given us no
real superiority. Pitt replied, it was too early
to decide on what we would or would not restore.
The Duke of Marlborough had acquired superiority;
the peace of Utrecht gave it away. And then
(whether equity or flattery dictated the declaration)
he protested, that at the peace he would not give
up an iota of our Allies for any British consideration.
This, it was pretended, was to satisfy the
Landgrave of Hesse, who was afraid of being abandoned.
The Duke of Newcastle had early presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
an Address from the University of Cambridge, in
which that reverend body were by no means penurious
of compliments on the Hanoverian victory.
It was even resented at Court that the city of
London had been more reserved&mdash;so much were
times changed! a few years before, it was thought
lucky if the city did not pass some censure even on
success, if it came from that quarter. The victory
of Dettingen had been stigmatised as an escape.
The prisoners now brought from Louisburg raised
the numbers of that nation captive here to twenty-four
thousand; and the King of France, to increase
the burthen of our expense, withdrew his allowance
to them. Admiral Osborn, too, received the thanks
of the Commons, for the activity with which he
had guarded the Mediterranean, and by preventing
succours, contributed to the conquest of Cape Breton.
He was a man of singular modesty and
bravery, and had lost an eye by the palsy during
the hardship of his service; but being allied to
Admiral Byng, not the least notice was taken of
him by the King.</p>

<p>An army of near 95,000 British troops, and
near 7000 foreigners, were voted, and above twelve
millions of money raised for the service of the ensuing
year; an enormous sum to be furnished by a
country no larger than and so indebted as England,
but exceeded by the great benefits to which it contributed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
I mention these things in gross, and very cursorily;
they will be found at large in all our common
histories. Were I master of them, I should touch
on them with reluctance. The system of money,
the great engine on which all modern affairs turn,
is become of so complicated a nature, and labours
with such ungracious intricacies, that no beauties
of style, scarce any clearness of expression, can
reconcile it to a reader of common indolence. How
such systems would have perplexed the elegance
of Roman or Greek historians! what eloquent periods
could they have formed, encumbered with
three per-cents, discounts, premiums, South-sea annuities,
and East India bonds!</p>

<p>Nov. 28th, Dr. Shebbear, author of several letters
to the people of England, having been tried for
many treasonable expressions in the sixth of them,
was sentenced by the King’s Bench to stand in the
pillory, to be imprisoned for three years, and then
to find security of 1000<em>l.</em> for his good behaviour
for seven years following&mdash;the latter part of the
sentence importing in effect perpetual imprisonment,
for both the fortune and character of the man were
at the lowest ebb. Though he had been the most
open champion of the Jacobite cause, though his
libel tended to point out the mischiefs entailed on
this country by union with Hanover,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the bitterest parts of the work were a satire on
King William and King George the First, his venom
by no means flowed from principle. He had long declared
that he would write himself into a place or the
pillory, the latter of which proved his fate, as Mr.
Pelham, the purchaser of opponents, was dead, and
as Shebbear’s pen, though not without force, could
not find the way to be hired by the Duke of Newcastle.
The most remarkable part of this trial was
the Chief Justice Mansfield laying down for law,
that satires even on dead Kings were punishable.
Whatever obsolete statutes may pronounce, can any
thing be more foreign to the genius of English constitution,
nay, to the practice even of arbitrary
countries? Why are tyrants sacred, when once
dead? Adieu! veracity and history, if the King’s
Bench is to appreciate your expressions! If the
dead are not to be censured, it is only pronouncing
history a libel, and the annals of Britain shall grow
as civil things as the sermons at St. James’s.</p>

<p>It was a misfortune that Shebbear had gone such
enormous lengths, that the warmest friends to the
liberty of the press could scarce lament the handle
taken to restrain its licentiousness. On the 5th of
December the man stood in the pillory, having a
footman holding an umbrella to keep off the rain.
The mob received him with three huzzas: he had had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the confidence to disperse printed bills, <em>inviting the
friends of the liberty of the press and of old England
to be at Charing Cross by twelve o’clock of
that day, to see the British champion</em>. Colonel
Robert Brudenel, a hot-headed and foolish young officer,
threatened the sheriff for the indulgence allowed to
Shebbear, and the King’s Bench afterwards actually
punished him. Insignificant as the man, and scandalous
as his cause was, such periods are often
critical to liberty. The Court victorious, the Minister
popular, an arbitrary magistrate, a worthless
criminal, officers undiscerning and ready to act any
violence when their master is affronted&mdash;how little
was wanted to roll the machine of Power to any
eminence!</p>

<p>The miscarriages at St. Maloes and St. Cas, and
the slender advantages accruing even from success
at Cherbourg, had a little opened Mr. Pitt’s eyes.
He could not help seeing that the slaughter at St.
Cas was not very preferable to the bloodless return
from Rochfort. He recollected that Conway had
offered to be as rash as Blighe, though having at
the same time thrown judgment into his plan. If
Blighe was punished for exposing his troops, and
Mordaunt and Conway for bringing back theirs in
safety, the implication was that Mr. Pitt would pardon
nothing but victory. These or some such
reflections made him change his behaviour to
Conway. Both the brothers being in waiting at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Kensington, Pitt took Lord Hertford aside, and
told him he knew the nicety of the subject on which
he was going to speak; that a new expedition being
projected to the West Indies, and Hobson appointed
to the command, he (Pitt) desired to explain to his
Lordship, that no opposition from him had prevented
Mr. Conway from being employed on it, as the latter
had so earnestly solicited to be. The case had
stood thus: one day finding the Duke of Newcastle,
Marshal Ligonier, and the King’s Ministers, consulting
who should command the expedition, he (Pitt)
had said, “Perhaps my presence lays you under
difficulties, but I object to nobody; pray consider
who is most proper, and I shall be for him.” That
he then retired to the other end of the room, while
a list was formed of Conway, Cornwallis, Lord
Albemarle, Hobson, and Moyston, which Lord Ligonier
immediately carried to the King, who chose
Hobson. Pitt added to Lord Hertford, “He was
sorry things had gone so far; he now thought of
Mr. Conway as he had done formerly, though he
could not give up his private opinion about Rochfort,
yet he should be concerned if Mr. Conway was
not employed.”</p>

<p>On these overtures Conway visited Pitt, neglecting
nothing that might procure him to be sent on
action. He was soon after commissioned to settle
with the French a cartel for the exchange of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
prisoners, put upon the staff, and the following
summer commanded in the lines at Chatham&mdash;but
it went no farther: Pitt, unapt to forget or to forgive,
seemed to have made these acknowledgments
and reparations to his own character, not to Conway’s;
and while Pitt would lend no hand to restore
him to service, the Duke of Newcastle, supposing
Conway more attached to the Duke of Cumberland
than to him, was glad to keep him down, and
to let the obstructions be imputed to Pitt. It was
natural they should: Pitt took on himself the
province of war and foreign operations: the whole
domestic he left to Newcastle, and, except from
foreign Ministers, would receive neither visits nor
court. He lived in the same recluse manner as
when a valetudinary patriot, indulging his own unsociable
humour, and acquiring popularity, while
he kept off friends and attachments. Yet some
symptoms now and then appeared of deeper designs.
Munchausen having presented an ample bill of extraordinaries
for forage, &amp;c., Pitt affected to be
much offended at its exorbitance, said the whole
should be laid before the House, and the members
should be summoned to examine and consider the
estimates. On this pretence he sent circular letters
to the Tories, whom the Treasury never used to
invite to any parliamentary attendance. Nothing
could be more artful than this step. Pitt knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
himself not agreeable to the Whigs, the whole body
of which were cantoned out in attachments to
the Dukes of Newcastle, Devonshire, and Bedford,
and to Fox. The Scotch were devoted to Argyle,
or looked up to Lord Bute. The Tories had no
leader. This summons captivated them, and at
the same time tied up their civil gratitude from
exercising any rigour on the Hanoverian accounts.
Nay, whatever was demanded, was granted or
allowed with such inconsiderate facility, that Lord
Mansfield, to stigmatise Pitt’s measures and profusion,
and the Parliament’s condescension, called
it <em>The South-sea year</em>.</p>

<p>At the end of the year died Lord Arran, an
inoffensive old man, the last male of the illustrious
House of Ormond. He was Chancellor of Oxford,
and much respected by the Jacobites, who had
scarce any partizans left in whom they might
venerate even a noble name. Sir George Lee died
at the same time.</p>

<p>In France happened a sudden revolution, as soon
forgotten as it had been unforeseen. The Cardinal
de Bernis was the new Prime Minister. He had an
easy talent for trifling poetry; it was his whole
merit and his whole fortune. Madame Pompadour
was pleased with some of his incense offered to her,
and first sent him to Venice, then to the Hague,
where he distinguished himself by an intriguing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
vivacity. These qualifications and his attachment
to her seemed solid enough to the mistress to fit
the Abbé-Comte de Bernis for the government
of France, where even these superficial talents were
not outshined, so exhausted in that country was the
vein of genius. Bernis was made a Cardinal, and
amassed benefices to the amount of 14,000<em>l.</em> a year;
but was scarce settled in that exalted station before
he received a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lettre de cachet</i> as he was going to
bed, ordering him to retire to his Bishopric by
ten the next morning. The cause of this rapid
fall was imputed to his own folly. He who had
scrupled to receive no benefits from the mistress,
nay, whose flatteries had obtained the greatest, and
whose conscience had stooped to owe to her interest
the first dignity in the church, grew at once conscientiously
ungrateful, and arrogantly absurd, refusing
to wait on her in her apartment, and to
communicate in the dignity of the purple with a
woman of so unsanctimonious a character. The
world laughed at his impertinent pretences, and she
punished them. Lord Granville, hearing the swift
progress of this meteor, said, “Soh! his ministry
has been almost as short as mine!”</p>

<p>At this stage I shall make a pause in my work,
uncertain whether ever to be resumed, though I am
rather inclined to prolong it to the conclusion of
the war. I warn my readers, however, not to expect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
as much intelligence and information in any
subsequent pages of these Memoirs as may have appeared
in the preceding. During the former period
I lived in the centre of business, was intimately
connected with many of the chief actors, was eager
in politics, indefatigable in heaping up knowledge
and materials for my work. Now, detached from
those busy scenes, with many political connexions
dropped or dissolved, indifferent to events, and indolent,
I shall have fewer opportunities of informing
myself of others. And here perhaps it may not be
improper, or unwelcome to the reader, if I say some
words on the author of these Memoirs: the frankness
of the manner will prove it flows from no vain
glory; yet to take off all such appearance, and to
avoid a nauseous egotism, I shall make use of the
third person.</p>

<p>Horace Walpole, without the least tincture of
ambition, had a propensity to faction, and looked
on the mischief of civil disturbances as a lively
amusement. Indignation at the persecution raised
against his father, and prejudices contracted by
himself, conspired with his natural impetuosity of
temper to nourish this passion. But coming into
the world when the world was growing weary of
faction, and some of the objects dying or being removed,
against whom his warmth had been principally
directed, maturity of reason and sparks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
virtue extinguished this culpable ardour. Balanced
for a few years between right and wrong, happily
for him virtue preponderated early enough to
leave him some merit in the option. Arts, books,
painting, architecture, antiquities, and those amiable
employments of a tranquil life, to which in the
warmest of his political hours he had been fondly
addicted, assumed an entire empire over him. The
circumstances too of the times contributed to make
him withdraw from the scene of business. With
Newcastle he had determined never to connect:
Fox’s behaviour on the case of Mr. Byng had
rooted out his esteem, and the coldness discovered
by Fox on Walpole’s refusing to concur in all his
politics, had in a manner dissolved their friendship.
Of Pitt he retained the best opinion; but the
wanton exposure of so many lives at the affair of
St. Cas, and in those other visionary attempts on
the coast of France, had painted Pitt on his mind
as a man whose thirst of glory was inconsistent with
humanity; and being himself strongly tinctured
with tenderness, he avoided any further intercourse
with a Minister, who was Great with so little reluctance.</p>

<p>Thus without disgrace, disappointment, or personal
disgust, Walpole, at the age of forty-one,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
abandoned the theatre of affairs; and retaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
neither resentment to warp, nor friendship to bias
him, he thinks himself qualified to give some account
of transactions, which few men have known
better, and of which scarce any can speak with
equal impartiality. He has not falsified a circumstance
to load any man; he has not denied a wrong
act to excuse himself. Yet lest even this unreserve
should not be thought sufficient, lest some secret
motive should be supposed to have influenced his
opinions, at least his narrative, he will lay open to
the reader his nearest sentiments. Severity in
some of the characters will be the most striking objection.
His dislike to a few persons probably
sharpened his eyes to their faults, but he hopes
never blinded him to their virtues&mdash;lest it should
have done, especially in so inflammable a nature,
he admonishes the reader of his greatest prejudices,
as far as they could have risen from any provocation.
From the Duke of Cumberland, Mr. Pelham,
and Lord Hardwicke, he had received trifling
offence. To the two last he avows he had strong
aversion. From Mr. Fox, as I have said, he had
felt coldness and ingratitude. By his uncle and
the Duke of Devonshire he had been injured&mdash;by
the former basely betrayed; yet of none of these has
he omitted to speak with praise when he could find
occasion. Of Lord Hardwicke had he known a
virtue, he would have told it: for now, when his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
passions are subsided, when affection and veneration
for truth and justice preponderate above all other
considerations, would he sacrifice the integrity of
these Memoirs, his favourite labour, to a little revenge
that he shall never taste? No; let his narration
be measured by this standard, and it will be
found that the unamiableness of the characters he
blames imprinted those dislikes, as well as private
distaste to some of them. The King, the Duke of
Newcastle, and others, who do not appear in these
writings with any signal advantage, never gave him
the most distant cause of dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>How far his own character may have concurred
towards forming his opinions may be calculated from
the following picture, impartial as far as a man can
know himself.</p>

<p>Walpole had a warm conception, vehement attachments,
strong aversions; with an apparent contradiction
in his temper&mdash;for he had numerous
caprices, and invincible perseverance. His principles
tended to republicanism, but without any of
its austerity; his love of faction was unmixed with
any aspiring. He had great sense of honour, but
not great enough, for he had too much weakness to
resist doing wrong, though too much sensibility not
to feel it in others. He had a great measure of
pride, equally apt to resent neglect, and scorning
to stoop to any meanness or flattery. A boundless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
friend; a bitter, but a placable enemy. His humour
was satiric, though accompanied with a most
compassionate heart. Indiscreet and abandoned to
his passions, it seemed as if he despised or could
bear no constraint; yet this want of government of
himself was the more blameable, as nobody had
greater command of resolution whenever he made
a point of it. This appeared in his person: naturally
very delicate, and educated with too fond a
tenderness, by unrelaxed temperance and braving
all inclemency of weathers, he formed and enjoyed
the finest and unabated health. One virtue he
possessed in a singular degree&mdash;disinterestedness
and contempt of money&mdash;if one may call that a
virtue, which really was a passion. In short, such
was his promptness to dislike superiors, such his
humanity to inferiors, that, considering how few
men are of so firm a texture as not to be influenced
by their situation, he thinks, if he may be allowed
to judge of himself, that had either extreme of
fortune been his lot, he should have made a good
prince, but not a very honest slave.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the reign which furnished the
preceding Memoirs arrived so soon after the period
where I quitted my narration, and was terminated
by such a scene of glory, that it would be unpardonable
to break off the thread in the most interesting
moment of our annals. The particular
events will be detailed by many writers, more accurately
perhaps, and more circumstantially: but as
I am accustomed to relate our story with exact
fidelity to the impressions it made on me, the picture
of so memorable an era drawn by an eyewitness
must, with all its faults and prejudices, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
more striking to future readers, than the cold and
critical detail which men less partial may hereafter
retrace and digest on a regular plan.</p>

<p>These volumes, however, having swelled to a
bulk far beyond my first intention, I shall endeavour
to restrain this sketch to as compact dimensions
as perspicuity will admit of. Descriptions of
battles and victories I have always avoided, as not
coming within the scope of my purpose, and from
my ignorance in military transactions. Even the
glorious campaigns which will be the chief subjects
of the two years I am going to write of, will be
but slightly touched: their consequences alone are
my object. Intrigues of the Cabinet, or of Parliament,
scarce existed at that period. All men
were, or seemed to be, transported with the success
of their country, and content with an Administration
which outwent their warmest wishes, or made
their jealousy ashamed to show itself. Few new
characters appeared on the stage. One episode<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
indeed there was, in which less heroic affections
were concerned; but having given rise to no memorable
catastrophe, nor disturbed the shining
order of events, it will not demand a long narration,
though it will diversify the story, and, by the
intermixture of human passions, serve to convince
posterity that such a display of immortal actions as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
illustrate the following pages is not the exhibition
of a fabulous age.</p>

<p>The winter of this great year was not memorable.
I shall briefly skim the events of it. The Chancellorship
of Oxford was vacant by the death of
Lord Arran.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The candidates were the Earls of
Westmoreland<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and Lichfield,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and Trevor, Bishop
of Durham. The last, who had the appearance of
a Court-candidate, was yet Tory enough not to
make him despair of success. Lord Lichfield’s
education, principles, and connexions were still
more favourable to <em>his</em> hopes. He lived in the
neighbourhood, was unalterably good-humoured,
and if he did not make the figure that his youth
had promised, the Jacobites could not reproach
him, as he had drowned his parts in the jovial
promotion of their cause&mdash;but of late he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>warped a little from what they thought loyalty.
Lord Westmoreland was an aged man, of gravity
and dignity, married to a Cavendish, and formerly
so attached to the House of Hanover, that he commanded
the very body of troops which King
George I. had been obliged to send to Oxford to
teach the University the only kind of passive obedience
which they did not approve. But having
fallen into the intimacy of Lord Chesterfield and
Lord Cobham during the Opposition to Sir Robert
Walpole, his regiment<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> was taken from him, and
his resentment, which was not so versatile as theirs,
had led him to imbibe all the nonsensical tenets of
the Jacobites. They wanted a representative, and
he was a comely one. The choice accordingly fell
on him, after Lord Lichfield, who divided the
Tories, had flung his interest into that scale to
prevent the election of the Bishop.</p>

<p>The cloud which had hung over General Conway
since the disappointment at Rochfort began to disperse.
He was commissioned to meet at Sluys
Monsieur de Bareil, who commanded in French
Flanders, and to settle a cartel for the exchange of
prisoners. The distresses of France had obliged
that Crown to withdraw their allowance from their
prisoners here, who were so numerous as to make
that scanty stipend an object: it seemed none to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the generosity of this country to replace it&mdash;private
and voluntary subscriptions<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> were even made for
their relief. The cartel was immediately and satisfactorily
settled: yet as Mr. Pitt could not digest
the smallest deviation from his plans, the essence of
which was rashness, and as he wisely was desirous
of inspiring the most romantic valour into our
officers and troops, nothing could prevail on him to
trust another enterprise to Mr. Conway, who panted
for an opportunity of encountering the rudest
dangers that Mr. Pitt could chalk out. But Conway
was still crossed; and even Moyston, who
pleaded ignorance of his profession, to excuse himself
from being employed on the West Indian expeditions,
was, by the favour of Newcastle, whose
creature he then was, preferred to Conway for service
in Germany.</p>

<p>On the 12th of January died Anne, Princess-Royal
of England and Dowager of Orange, the
King’s eldest daughter, and Gouvernante of the
Republic during the minority of her son, in the
fiftieth year of her age. She left no children but
the young Stadtholder,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> of eleven years of age, and
the Princess Caroline. Her last offices had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>employed in preventing a rupture between Great
Britain and Holland, which was ready to break out
on the many captures we had made of their vessels
carrying supplies to the French settlements.</p>

<p>The first conquest that opened the year was the
capture of Goree by Commodore Keppel.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> That
island had indeed surrendered on the 29th of
December preceding; but the account did not
arrive till the 27th of this month. An expedition
of far higher importance was at that time
on the point of departing. The war was to be
carried into the heart and to the capital of the
French empire in America; and so weakened was
the force of that Monarchy on that side of the
globe, by their encroachments, in which they had
drawn upon themselves such extensive vengeance,
that this was not attempted to be made a secret
expedition. Quebec was the object, and was
avowed to be so. Another fleet had sailed in November,
to attempt the reduction of Martinico and
Guadaloupe, under the direction of General Hopson
and Commodore Moore. The former was old
and infirm: brave, but neither able nor experienced:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Moore has been mentioned before. On
Martinico the attempt miscarried. Moore was
blamed by some for want of activity; but his
subservience to the Ministry on the affair of Admiral
Byng had secured such favour to him, that,
in the Extraordinary Gazette published on this
disappointment, Moore was treated with great
lenity, and the blame made to bear hard on Hopson,
who, however, survived long enough to expire
in the arms of victory; for, on the failure at Martinico,
the troops embarked with alacrity for Guadaloupe,
and carried that island by dint of bravery.
Basseterre, the capital, was reduced to a heap of
ashes by the artillery from the Fleet; and Hopson
died in possession of the ruins. The remainder of
the island was subdued by General Barrington,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
who succeeded to the command, and Colonel
Clavering. Moyston,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> as I have said, had been
named for this service, but professed he knew
nothing of his trade: yet, on a promotion of
general officers, before which the King, as usual,
made a promotion of Hanoverians in the same line,
by which some Major-Generals were now put over the
head of General Waldegrave, who had commanded
them in the last campaign; Moyston, of the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>rank with Waldegrave, offered to serve under the
new Hanoverian <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Lieutenant-Generals, if'">Lieutenants-General, if</ins> he might
be sent to Germany; which well-timed flattery
obtained his suit. On his waving Martinico, Pitt
carried a list of names to the King, who selected
Hopson&mdash;a choice not consonant to Mr. Pitt’s
practice, who, considering that our ancient officers
had grown old on a very small portion of experience,
which by no means compensated for the
decay of fire and vigour, chose to trust his plans to
the alertness and hopes of younger men.</p>

<p>This appeared particularly in the nomination of
Wolfe for the enterprise on Quebec. Ambition,
activity, industry, passion for the service, were
conspicuous in Wolfe. He seemed to breathe for
nothing but fame, and lost no moments in qualifying
himself to compass his object. He had studied for
his purpose, and wrote well. Presumption on himself
was necessary to such a character; and he had
it. He was formed to execute the designs of such
a master as Pitt, till risen to an eminence, whence
he might choose to thwart his master. To Wolfe
was associated George Townshend,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> whose proud,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and sullen, and contemptuous temper never suffered
him to wait for thwarting his superiors till risen to
a level with them. He saw everything in an ill-natured
and ridiculous light&mdash;a sure prevention of
ever being seen himself in a great or favourable one.
The haughtiness of the Duke of Cumberland, the
talents or blemishes of Fox, the ardour of Wolfe,
the virtue of Conway, all were alike the objects of
Townshend’s spleen and contradiction&mdash;but Wolfe
was not a man to wave his pre-eminence from fear
of caricatures. He felt his superior knowledge and
power, and had spirit enough to make Townshend
sensible at least of the latter&mdash;a confidence in himself
that was fortunate for his country: but we must
pass to the other events of the year which preceded
the decision of that attempt.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt, on entering upon Administration, had
found the nation at the lowest ebb in point of power
and reputation. His predecessors, now his coadjutors,
wanted genius, spirit, and system. The
Fleet had many able officers; but the Army, which,
since the resignation of the Duke of Cumberland,
had lost sight of discipline, was destitute of Generals
in whom either the nation or the soldiery had any
confidence. France, who meaned to be feared, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
feared heartily; and the heavy debt of the nation,
which was above fourscore millions, served as an
excuse to those who understood nothing but little
temporary expedients to preach up our impossibility
of making an effectual stand. They were willing
to trust that France would be so good as to ruin us
by inches.</p>

<p>Pitt had roused us from this ignoble lethargy:
he had asserted that our resources were still prodigious&mdash;he
found them so in the intrepidity of our
troops and navies&mdash;but he went farther, and perhaps
too far. He staked our revenues with as little
management as he played with the lives of the
subjects; and as if we could never have another
war to wage, or as if he meant, which was impracticable,
that his Administration should decide which
alone should exist as a nation, Britain or France,
he lavished the last treasures of this country with a
prodigality beyond example and beyond excuse;
yet even that profusion was not so blameable as his
negligence. Ignorant of the whole circle of finance,
and consequently averse from corresponding with
financiers, a plain set of men, who are never to be
paid with words instead of figures, he kept aloof
from all details, drew magnificent plans, and left
others to find the magnificent means. Disdaining,
too, to descend into the operations of an office which
he did not fill, he affected to throw on the Treasury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the execution of measures which he dictated, but
for which he thus held himself not responsible. The
conduct was artful, new, and grand; and to him
proved most advantageous. Secluded from all eyes,
his orders were received as oracles; and their success,
of consequence, was imputed to his inspiration.
Misfortunes and miscarriages fell to the account of
the more human agents: corruption and waste were
charged on the subordinate priests. They indeed
were charmed with this dispensation.</p>

<p>As Mr. Pitt neither granted suits nor received
them, Newcastle revelled in a boundless power of
appointing agents, commissaries, victuallers, and the
whole train of leeches, and even paid his court to
Pitt by heaping extravagance on extravagance; for
the more money was thrown away, the greater idea
Pitt conceived of his system’s grandeur. But none
flattered this ostentatious prodigality like the Germans.
From the King of Prussia<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and Prince
Ferdinand to the lowest victualler in the camp, all
made advantage of English easiness and dissipation.
As the Minister was proud of such pensioners, they
were not coy in begging his alms. Fox, too, was
not wanting to himself during this harvest, to which
his office of Paymaster opened so commodious an
inlet. Depressed, annihilated as a statesman, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
sat silent, indemnifying himself by every opportunity
of gain which his rival’s want of economy threw in
his way. The larger and more numerous are subsidies,
the more troops are in commission, the more
are on service abroad, the ampler means has the
Paymaster of enriching himself. An unfortunate
campaign, or an unpopular peace might shake the
Minister’s establishment&mdash;but till this vision of expensive
glory should be dissipated, Fox was determined
to take no part. But thence, from that
inattention on one hand, and rapacity on the other,
started up those prodigious private fortunes which
we have seen suddenly come forth&mdash;and thence
we remained with a debt of an hundred and forty
millions!</p>

<p>The admirers of Mr. Pitt extol the reverberation
he gave to our councils, the despondence he banished,
the spirit he infused, the conquests he made, the
security he affixed to our trade and plantations, the
humiliation of France, the glory of Britain carried,
under his Administration, to a pitch at which it
never had arrived&mdash;and all this is exactly true.
When they add, that all this could not be purchased
too dearly, and that there was no option between
this conduct and tame submission to the yoke of
France&mdash;even this is just in a degree; but a material
objection still remains, not depreciating a grain from
this bill of merits, which must be gratefully acknowledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
by whoever calls himself Englishman&mdash;yet
very derogatory from Mr. Pitt’s character, as virtually
trusted with the revenues, the property of his
country. A few plain words will explain my
meaning, and comprehend the force of the question.
All this was done&mdash;but might have been done for
many millions less&mdash;the next war will state this objection
more fully.</p>

<p>Posterity, this is an impartial picture. I am
neither dazzled by the blaze of the times in which I
have lived, nor, if there are spots in the sun, do I
deny that I see them. It is a man I am describing,
and one, whose greatness will bear to have his
blemishes fairly delivered to you&mdash;not from a love
of censure in me, but of truth; and because it is
history I am writing, not romance. I pursue my
subject.</p>

<p>The estimates of the year will show how our expenses
increased. When the Ways and Means were
to be voted, the disposition of Mr. Pitt, which I
have mentioned, appeared; and some other passions.
He had taken umbrage at Legge from the time the
latter had been associated with him in the testimonials
of popularity which they had received together
from many counties and corporations, or he might
have discovered some of Legge’s subterraneous intrigues.
The new-intended tax to answer part of
the supplies granted, was destined to fall on sugar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Pitt, who rarely condescended to make use of any
instrument for acquiring popularity, was less reserved
on this head with regard to Beckford, who was a
noisy, good-humoured flatterer, bombast, as became
the priest of such an idol, and vulgar and absurd,
as was requisite to captivate any idol’s devotees, the
mob. On that class in the City, Beckford had much
influence. He was pompous in his expense, or
rather in his expressions, but he knew his interest,
and was attentive to it. His fortune lay chiefly in
Jamaica&mdash;a tax on sugar touched his vitals. Accompanied
by fifty West-Indian merchants, he applied
to Legge to divert the new duty; but the measure
was taken. He was obliged to have recourse to Pitt,
who professed being little in the secret of money-matters;
promised the affair should have farther
consideration, and that himself would be open to
conviction on what he should hear in the debate.</p>

<p>The chiefs of the City had already been acquainted
with the tax, and approved it; but Pitt obliged
Newcastle and Legge to depart from their plan,
though at so late a day, and to shift the new duty
upon dry goods in general. Yet when the debate
came on, Pitt reproved Legge for having been so
dilatory with the taxes; and made an extravagant
panegyric on Beckford, who, he said, had done more
to support Government than any Minister in England;
launched out on his principles, disinterestedness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
knowledge of trade, and solidity; and professed
he thought him another Sir Josiah Child. The
House, who looked on Beckford as a wild, incoherent,
superficial buffoon, of whose rhapsodies they were
weary, laughed and groaned. Pitt was offended,
and repeated his encomium, as the House did their
sense of it. He added, that he thought a tax on
wine or linens preferable to that on dry goods
(which included sugar as part): he wished either
had been proposed sooner: now he must <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sequi deteriora</i>&mdash;yet
why did he talk of his being consulted?
<em>Accident, jumble, and twenty circumstances, had
placed him in an odd gap of government&mdash;but only
for a time&mdash;he only desired to be an instrument
of government, and the drudge of office.</em> He
wished for no power; he had seen what effect it had
had on his predecessors!</p>

<p>But the most remarkable part of his speech on
that and a following day, at least what was much
recollected a few years afterwards,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> was the commendation
he bestowed upon <em>excise</em>, upon Sir
Robert Walpole’s plan for it,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and upon that Minister.
He concluded with declaring, that he should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>like a tax on hops better than on any commodity
that had been mentioned. This, too, was very ill
received by the House. Legge, as usual, kissed
the rod with much humility&mdash;yet many, who knew
he deserved to be crushed, did not approve the violent
manner in which it was done.</p>

<p>On the Corn Bill, Sir John Philipps reproached
Pitt with Hanoverizing. Soame Jenyns, a humorous
poet, had indirectly done the same in a simile to
ridicule the Tories, whom Pitt was leading towards
the Court, and who had already gone so far as to
agree to his most extravagant demands for Germany.
Pitt was grievously hurt; and it required all the
intercession and protection of Lord Hardwicke to
save Jenyns from being turned out of the Board of
Trade. Pitt was no less complaisant to Lord Hardwicke
on a point of higher importance. Lord Denbigh<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
acquainted the House of Lords, that he should
move to ask the Judges for their new Act of Habeas
Corpus, (which Lord Hardwicke had promised to
prepare,) and said he did not doubt but that Lord
would second his motion. The Judges were accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
summoned&mdash;but Lord Denbigh told them he
had dropped his design. As he professed attachment
to Pitt, the inference was obvious.</p>

<p>The Archbishop of Canterbury, who could be obsequious,
too, and who was showing great management
for the Methodists, so far as to enter into their
superstitious prosecution of the bakers for baking
on Sundays, was not rigid even on that or still more
solemn days, when he looked towards Court. On
the general fast he acquainted the King by the Lord
Chamberlain, that he had provided a preacher for
his Majesty, who would have all proper regard to
necessary brevity&mdash;but the man happened to preach
half an hour&mdash;double the time to which the King
was accustomed; who complaining that the Archbishop
had deceived him, the flattery came to light.
The Prelate was not less attentive to paying his
court in a point of greater moment. The King,
persuaded that his indulgence to and toleration of
the Catholics would secure him from their plotting,
was constantly averse to every proposition of rigour
towards them. Representations of Justices of Peace
against their chapels in private houses were always
quashed. Of late it had appeared in print, by concurrent
testimonies of opposite parties on the controversy
with Bower,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> that a regular mission of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Jesuits was established in London. They had
attempted or suggested the assassination of the King
of Portugal; they were detected and decried in
France&mdash;Catholic kingdoms&mdash;in London no notice
was taken of them. The Primate was too much
occupied on forcing Protestant bakers to church,
and in providing laconic preachers for his master!</p>

<p>Newcastle had now been long enough connected
with Pitt to grow jealous of him once more. On a fine
speech in the House of Lords, for the importation of
Irish cattle, made by the Duke of Bedford, Newcastle
commended him extravagantly; and soon after, a connexion
between them recommenced by the intervention
of Fox and the Duke of Bedford’s creatures. The
consequences, however, did not soon appear, except
in mutual diffidences of Newcastle and Pitt, the
former of whom suspected the latter of designing to
break on some popular topic; an opportunity
which therefore the new connexion determined
not to throw in his way, apprehending the power
of his popularity. The jealousy, however, frequently
broke out: the instances, trifling as they were, I
shall sometimes briefly mention, as several of them
led to higher matters.</p>

<p>The Privy Council sitting to hear the case
argued of the captures made on the Dutch; Pitt,
sensible of the clamour that would be raised, if the
prizes were restored, went officiously early to the
House of Commons, to mark, by his not being at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Council, his taking no part in the decision. Newcastle
went thither; but perceiving the politic absence
of Pitt, his Grace pretended the chamber was
too hot, and retired too. This was followed by the
affair of the Judges: on a proposal the last year to
exempt them from the new tax on employments, it
had been agreed rather to increase their salaries.
Legge had promised a Bill for that purpose; and
John Campbell,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> of Calder, a staunch revolutionist,
said he would add a motion to convert their commissions
during good behaviour into patents for life.
Then followed the Debate on the Habeas Corpus,
on which, though the opinions of the Judges were
divided, they certainly were not very favourable to
Mr. Pitt and the friends of the extension. Now
when the time was arrived for fixing those salaries,
Pitt told Newcastle that the increase had been
made to reward the complaisance of the Judges on the
Bill of Habeas Corpus, <em>and that it was the largest
fee that ever was given</em>. This terrified the Duke
so much, that he prevailed on Campbell to drop his
intended Motion. The King, too, disapproved it;
wishing, when he could, to leave the prerogative as
ample as he found it. The Treasury, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
having advanced the salaries, were censured by
Lord Denbigh and Lord Temple. Yet when it
came before the House, Pitt, though he warmly opposed
it in private, did not attend; but his friends,
George Grenville and Beckford, attacked the Motion,
and a Mr. Coventry told many entertaining stories
of the Judges and their rapaciousness on the circuit,
and of casual presents that they had converted into
standing usages. Charles Yorke defended both the
Judges and the measure&mdash;the latter with more success
than the former: yet as the stories were neither
flagrant nor of very recent date, the best apology
for the Judges was, that so little could be objected
to them. The additional salary was voted by 169
to 39; which occasioned Charles Townshend to say,
<em>that the book of Judges had been saved by the
book of Numbers</em>.</p>

<p>Legge, who officially made the Motion, did not
escape Pitt’s anger; but he was protected by Newcastle,
to whom he had newly attached himself.
The first interview passed with such privacy, that
they met at Lord Dupplin’s without candles. Yet
Newcastle discovered it to Pitt, and others to Lord
Bute, which completed the ruin of Legge with both.
Lord Bute immediately showed his resentment by
excluding Oswald, though a Scot, from the Treasury,
because recommended by Legge; and even to
Pitt, Lord Bute made use of the name of the Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of Wales to fortify the exclusion. Legge, however,
was indemnified by obtaining the vacant post for
his friend Lord North.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>These were the most remarkable, and not very
interesting events of that session, which concluded
with a Message from the King to desire to be enabled
to march the Militia out of their several counties
on the apprehension of an invasion from France.
Notice of such an intention had been received so
early as February last. Fifty thousand men were
said to be destined for that service, which formerly
had been a plan of Marshal Belleisle in the last war,
had been communicated to the King of Prussia, and
approved of by him. Pitt made a pompous speech
on delivery of the Message, and distinguished
between the various kinds of fear: this, he said,
was a magnanimous fear. The Address in return
was still more lofty. Vyner and Cooke added an
Address, that his Majesty would quicken such Lords
Lieutenant as were dilatory with their Militias&mdash;there
were several of them; the measure was far
from being generally popular. When they did
come to march, several country gentlemen would
have excused themselves on the season of hay harvest.
Pitt answered, that if any such objection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
were made, he would, move the next session to have
the Bill repealed&mdash;a dreadful threat to his Tory
friends, who, by the silent <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douceurs</i> of commissions
in the Militia, were weaned from their opposition,
without a sudden transition to ministerial employment.</p>

<p>The invasion, though it ended in smoke, was
very seriously projected, and hung over us for
great part of the summer; nor was it radically baffled
till the winter following. Immense preparations
were made along their coasts of flat-bottomed boats.
They even notified their design to the Dutch; but
at the same time informing the States, that they
did not intend to disturb the established succession,
but to punish England for her attempts on their
coasts the last year. This notification had the
least serious air in the whole transaction, but accorded
with those weak councils, which knew not
how to conduct any of their operations. We were
defenceless at home, and could not assemble above
twelve thousand men. Our towns were crowded
with French prisoners. They were removed up
into the country, and committed to the guard of
the Militia. The Earl of Orford,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> with the Militia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
of Norfolk, was garrisoned at Portsmouth, whence
they addressed the King with offers and promises
of service&mdash;a zeal somewhat unconstitutional, and
indicating how far from impossible it might be to
divert this national force to the same purposes as
are always reasonably apprehended from a standing
Army. In the present case the apprehension was
the more pregnant, as the officers of the Militia
were chiefly Tory gentlemen.</p>

<p>To ward off or dissipate the invasion, Admiral
Rodney<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> was dispatched to the French coast; and
arriving off Havre de Grace, he with two bomb-ketches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
set fire to the town in two or three
places, though the fire from the forts was very
warm. He threw so prodigious a number of bombs
into the place, that he almost melted his own
mortars; but the flat-bottomed boats, which were
not finished, proved to be out of his reach; and
he returned with having done but inconsiderable
damage. About the same time advice being received
that Monsieur Thurot, with 1500 men under his
command, had escaped out of Dunkirk, another battalion
was flung into Dover Castle, and two more
were ordered into the lines at Chatham&mdash;but
Thurot was not then sailed.</p>

excise, but so virulent was the opposition made to it by his
enemies, that, though he carried it, he had been in danger of
his life, and was persuaded by his friends, against his own
opinion, to drop it. Almost all his chief opponents lived to
recant their opposition to that plan, as Mr. Pitt did on this
occasion; which was the handsomer, as he had lost his cornetcy
of horse, and his uncle Lord Cobham his regiment, for
their opposition on that occasion.</p></div>

<p>Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick had opened the
campaign with less success than reputation, having
been obliged to retreat after attempting to dislodge
the French from Bergen. It was this and some parallel
occasions in which the French stood their ground,
that intituled Prince Ferdinand most deservedly to
the character of a consummate General. Retreats
before a victorious Army, and prosperous campaigns
against a superior Army, these were his titles&mdash;the
incapacity of the hostile Generals, and the shameful
behaviour of their troops, rendered his subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
achievements less brilliant, without proving that
he would not have succeeded against abler antagonists.
It is a little more problematic whether he
could not have served us better, had he had no
interests to serve but ours. As we were strictly
connected with the King of Prussia, co-operating
with him was serving the common cause. The
question is, whether Prince Ferdinand never lost
sight of the interests of Great Britain, when a motion,
a diversion that might shield that Monarch,
clashed with an obvious plan of activity for driving
the French out of the territories that more immediately
affected our cause.</p>

<p>The advantage of employing so able a German
General balanced some signal inconveniences attending
that nomination. The sums which were never
refused to him, and for which, not being a Briton,
he could not be called to account, will perhaps outweigh
the glory he procured to our arms, the benefits
that resulted from his success, or the share
which he made us take in saving the King of
Prussia from destruction. Should the last-named
Prince prove oftener our enemy than our Ally, we
must comfort ourselves with having guarded the
Protestant religion in Germany&mdash;for the Protestantism
of its chief, it was too ridiculous to be made,
as it was, even a serious object by the mob!
Atheistic odes were the psalms which that Protestant
confessor sung by the waters of Babylon!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>After the check at Bergen, Prince Ferdinand,
though retreating, disputed his ground by garrisoning
the chief towns on his march. Yet they were
all taken by the French, particularly Munster and
Minden. Hanover seemed again on the point
of becoming their prey. Nothing was left, but
to hazard a battle; on which the Prince determined,
and the news of which arrived here, when
such an event was least expected, except by the
King, who, on receiving General Yorke’s<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> courier,
owned that he had had Prince Ferdinand’s plan in
his pocket for ten days, without communicating it
to a single person. This testimony was given
immediately, before the slightest particulars were
known, except that the general result of the action
was complete success. Yet, however the event was
coincident with the design, however determined the
Prince was to provoke an engagement, it is rather
clear that he was surprised, though not by his own
fault, as came out afterwards.</p>

<p>Colonel Ligonier<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> followed General Yorke’s courier,
but had been dispatched so early from the field
of battle, that he scarce knew any of the circumstances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>except the great loss on the French side,
the large number of prisoners, with the capture of
their cannon and baggage.</p>

<p>Three days afterwards arrived Colonel Fitzroy,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
Aide-de-camp to Prince Ferdinand, with confirmation
of the victory; not so ample as in the first
intelligence, but decisive, and attended immediately
by essential advantages. Contades had passed the
river in the night, ordering the bridges to be destroyed.
Minden, with its garrison, surrendered
the next day. The loss on our side had not been
inconsiderable, and had fallen chiefly on the English,
who had also the greatest share in the honour
of the day. The Generals Kingsley and Waldegrave
had particularly distinguished themselves.</p>

<p>With Fitzroy came over the Duke of Richmond;
and they, particularly the latter, disclosed a passage,
which soon threw the nation into a flame.
Lord George Sackville,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> by his weight with Mr.
Pitt,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and in Parliament, had insisted on going to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>Germany, and had gone without the King’s approbation,
and even without waiting on his Majesty.
Lord Granby was next to Lord George in command,
and so popular, that when he set out for the Army,
fifty-two young officers had solicited to be his Aides-de-camp.
Between these two Lords a coolness soon
ensued, and divided the Army, if it can be called
<em>division</em>, where almost every heart sided with Lord
Granby. He was open, honest, affable, and of such
unbounded good-nature and generosity, that it was
impossible to say which principle actuated him in
the distribution of the prodigious sums that he spent
and flung away.</p>

<p>Lord George Sackville was haughty, reserved but
to a few, and those chiefly Scotch; and with no
pre-eminence over his rival, but what his rank in
command gave him, and his great talents, in which
there could not be the smallest competition; and
yet with those superior talents, Lord George never
had the art of conciliating affection. He had
thwarted Prince Ferdinand, and disgusted him, in
the preceding campaign; and was now in the Army
against the Prince’s inclination. The latter, with
equal haughtiness, but with far more art and address,
could not fail of fomenting a breach that
tended so much to mortify Lord George, and to
promote his own views. Lord Granby was tractable,
unsuspicious, and not likely to pry into or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
control the amazing impositions of the German
agents, which Lord George had too honestly, too
indiscreetly, or too insultingly, let Prince Ferdinand
see had not escaped his observation, instead of remonstrating
or withstanding such dissipation, as he
should have done, at home&mdash;though it is questionable
whether his representations would have been
listened to by Mr. Pitt, who cared not what he
lavished on whoever would carry on his glorious
sketches, or rather adventurous darings&mdash;a prodigality
unhappily copied in the next reign, throughout
the American war, by men who imitated Mr.
Pitt in nothing else, and who had none of his genius,
ambition, patriotism, activity, nor even his lofty
ideas.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>This was the state of things before the battle of
Minden; but being little or not at all known in
England, it was with equal surprise and indignation
that the people heard Lord George Sackville, who
had always stood in high estimation for courage,
more covertly at first, soon openly accused of cowardice,
and of having thrown away the moment of
completing the total destruction of the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Army. Prince Ferdinand had passed this reproach
on him, indirectly and artfully indeed, but, when
combined with the circumstances of the battle, not
to be misunderstood. In the orders which he gave
out the next day, he expressed concern that Lord
Granby had not had the command of the Cavalry
on the right wing, which, if led by him, his Highness
did not doubt would have given a more decisive
lustre to the day. More mysterious, yet still more
pointed, was a paragraph in the same orders, requiring
that, <em>for the future</em>, his commands, delivered
by his Aides-de-camp, should be more exactly
obeyed.</p>

<p>Inquiry soon led to the particular fact alluded to.
During the battle, the Prince sent Ligonier, one of
his Aides-de-camp, to Lord George, with orders to
bring up the Cavalry; Fitzroy immediately after,
with orders for Lord George to march with only the
British Cavalry, and to the left. Lord George, as
Fitzroy, who arrived suddenly after Ligonier, said,
received the order with some confusion, and replied,
“This cannot be so; would he have me break the
line?” Fitzroy, young, brave, and impetuous, urged
the command. Lord George desired he would not
be in a hurry. “I am out of breath with galloping,”
said Fitzroy, “which makes me speak quick;
but my orders are positive. The French are in
disorder; here is a glorious opportunity for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
English to distinguish themselves.” Lord George
still hesitated, saying, it was impossible the Prince
could mean to break the line. Fitzroy stuck to the
Prince’s orders. Lord George asked which way the
Cavalry was to march, and who was to be their
guide? “I!” said Fitzroy, bravely. Lord George
pretending the different orders puzzled him, desired
to be conducted to the Prince for explanation; in
the meantime dispatched Smith, his favourite, with
orders to lead on the British Cavalry; from whence,
he pleaded, no delay could happen. Smith whispered
Lord George, to convince him of the necessity
of obeying. Lord George persisted on being carried
to the Prince, who at Fitzroy’s report was much
astonished. Even when Lord George did march,
he twice sent orders to Lord Granby to halt, who
was posting on with less attention to the rules of a
march, but with more ardour for engaging. Before
they arrived, the battle was gained. Lord George
defended himself on the seeming contradiction of
the orders; on the short space of time that was
lost, at most eight minutes; on obstructions from a
wood on his march; and on his own alertness, he
having been one of the first on horseback on hearing
the French cannonade; the Prince of Anhalt
having neglected to send to Prince Ferdinand information
of the approach of the French, which he had
learnt from four deserters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>That the whole affair turned on very few minutes,
is certain. Whether, if employed, they would have
been of great consequence, cannot now be determined.
Enough was evident to prove that Lord
George, at best, was too critically and minutely
cool in such a moment of importance. Indeed,
more was proved. Previous to the arrival of Ligonier,
he had lost time in affecting not to understand
a message delivered to him by a German Aide-de-camp.
Colonel Sloper, too, (who had been obliged
to him,) remarking his confusion, said to Ligonier,
“For God’s sake, repeat your orders to that man,
that he may not pretend not to understand them&mdash;but
you see the condition he is in!” Had Lord
George’s courage been less problematic, one might
suspect that his hatred to Prince Ferdinand had
made him willing, by an affected delay, to balk the
Prince of part of his glory;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> but some late occasions
had already discovered that his Lordship was
no hero. The late Duke of Marlborough<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> had remarked
it in their joint expedition to the coast of
France; and the little spirit he had shown in Ireland,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>under the most grievous abuse, was now recollected,
and concurred to corroborate the present
imputation. His real constitution, I believe, was
this: he had a high and bold spirit, till danger
came extraordinarily near. Then his judgment
was fascinated&mdash;yet even then he seems not to have
lost a certain presence of mind. His quickness in
distinguishing a trifling contradiction in a message
delivered by two boys in not precisely the same
terms, showed that all his senses were not lost; but
if that dexterity served his fears, it cut up his fortune
by the roots, annihilated his character, and
gratified the utmost spleen and vengeance of his
enemy. I question if a fuller victory had been
more acceptable to Prince Ferdinand.</p>

<p>That disappointment alone had not provoked his
Highness, seemed to appear from the choice he
made of Lord Granby for the particular object of
his compliment. Though the next officer to Lord
George in the Cavalry, Lord Granby had only
marked a great readiness to lead them to the
charge; but had had no opportunity of otherwise
distinguishing himself. For Lord George, whether
unconscious of having failed in his duty; or
whether, which is more probable, to carry on the
semblance of having done it, he did not scruple to
mix with the general officers at Prince Ferdinand’s
table after the battle. “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voilà cet homme</i>,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the Prince to those nearest to him, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">autant à son
aise comme s’il avoit fait des merveilles</i>!” No
more passed then. The next day’s orders informed
Lord George that the Prince’s silence was no indemnity.
His Highness knew the English; and
left it to them to execute the rest.</p>

<p>Lord George Sackville felt the stroke. He saw
Germany and the Army were no longer a situation
for him. He wrote for leave to resign his command,
and to return. Both were granted. Ere he
could arrive, both the Court and the nation were
prepared to receive him with little less abhorrence
and abuse than had led the way to the fate of Admiral
Byng.</p>

<p>A promotion of Lieutenants-General was immediately
made, in order to include and hasten the
rank to General Waldegrave,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> to whom the success
of the battle had in great measure been owing.
The six English regiments, who sustained the whole
effort of the French, had begun the engagement
with less promise of valour. At first they began to
give way. Waldegrave, affecting not to perceive
that their motion tended towards a retreat, cried
out, “Wheel to the right!”&mdash;they did, and recovered
the day. Waldegrave was a man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
united much frankness with steady attention to his
interest. His parts were never taken notice of but
on this occasion: but such an occasion is immortality.</p>

<p>Seventy thousand men routed by 35,000 was indeed
a shining victory. The defeat of the French
was attended with scarce less rancour between their
Generals than happened between ours. The Marshals
Contades and Broglio threw the blame on each
other: but the former never recovered any share of
estimation. His papers, which fell into our hands
soon after the battle, were artfully published. They
included his correspondence with Marshal Belleisle,
who directed the operations of the war, and gave
orders for the conduct of it with a barbarity that
spoke very plainly how little France was influenced
by any sentiments of humanity or good faith in
pursuit of her views.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The Germans were treated
in those despatches with the most marked contempt;
the Princes suspected by them, despotically;
and even their friends, the Electors of Cologne and
Palatine, were to be made feel the misery of being
connected with a too powerful and arrogant Ally.
They were to be plundered under the observance of
the most insulting ceremonial. But what shocked
Europe most, were repeated commands to reduce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the most fertile provinces of Germany to a desert:
the pretence, to shorten the war. Had their meditated
invasions of this country succeeded, one may
judge what would have been the secret instructions
to their Generals!</p>

<p>We must now turn to the King of Prussia. The
efforts he had made in the preceding campaigns to
withstand so many enemies were again to be renewed.
The Russians were ready to burst on
Silesia, and were not a nation with whom he could
temporize, as he could with Marshal Daun, by
stratagems, shifting situations, and the other resources
of a politic general. Count Dohna, who
was opposed to them, had endeavoured to ward off
the blow by such expedients: but his master determined
in his own mind that the Russian storm should
be encountered by a shock like their own. He disgraced
Dohna, and substituted Wedel in his place,
with absolute command to risk a battle. Wedel
accordingly engaged seventy thousand Russians
with less than half their number, and was defeated.
The towns of Crossen and Francfort-on-the-Oder
fell into the hands of the conquerors.</p>

<p>The King, to vindicate his own measure, and
indeed from the necessity of making a decisive
effort, hastened with ten thousand men to the shattered
remains of Wedel’s army; while Marshal
Daun, who knew that the Russians wanted nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
but a body of cavalry, despatched twelve thousand
horse to them under General Laudohn, who was
accompanied, too, by eight thousand foot. This
supply made the Russian force amount to above
fourscore thousand men, already blooded with victory
and barbarity. The King, with all the recruits
he could collect, had not assembled above fifty
thousand men&mdash;enough to sacrifice to despair! It
was near the village of Cunnersdorf that he once
more tried what the most intrepid rashness could
perform. Even the advantage of situation was
against him; yet nothing stopped his impetuosity.
His Generals had no option: his troops were animated
by revenge, by the dangers that threatened
their country, and by the example of their King,
who was so far entitled to lavish the blood of his
soldiers, as he was prodigal of his own. Such
motives and such fury bore down all before them.
The Russian entrenchments were forced; seventy
pieces of their cannon were taken; posts after posts
were carried, and prodigious slaughter made of their
bravest battalions. The King, confident of success,
and impatient to notify it, despatched a courier
to the Queen with these words: “Madam, we have
beaten the Russians from their entrenchments; in
two hours expect to hear of a glorious victory.”
Unless he concluded that the expeditious divulging
of his success could check the progress of his other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
enemies, or encourage his people to withstand the
tempest that was ready to break upon them, this
anticipation of his good fortune was childish, and
more like the juvenile ardour of an unpractised
hero, than of a man accustomed both to victory and
reverses, and who was now fighting for dearer
objects than glory.</p>

<p>The promised two hours never arrived. Soltikoff,
the Russian General, collected the remains of
his right wing, and, with supplies drawn from his
centre, reinforced his left, which he observed to be
the most entire, and posted it on a rising ground to
advantage. The King, flushed with success, and
now engaged in honour to make it complete, resolved
to drive the Russians from that last post too.
The fatigue of his troops, the representations of his
Generals, the advantages already gained, nothing
could dissuade him from pushing his fortune to the
utmost. The command for attack was given, and
was obeyed with alacrity by the Prussians, though
almost spent by the heat of the day, and the efforts
they had exerted. At that moment the Austrian
cavalry, so judiciously furnished by Daun, and as
ably put in motion by Laudohn, rushed upon the
enfeebled victors, broke their ranks, drove them
back in disorder, and ravished from them in few
moments the fruit of their glorious ardour and intrepidity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>A total defeat of the Prussians ensued, notwithstanding
the undaunted valour of their monarch,
who could not recover by despair what he had let
slip out of his hands by presumption. Yet, to that
intemperance in action succeeded the coolest prudence
and judgment. He had acted as in despair at
the head of fifty thousand men; he took measures
for re-establishing his Army, when he knew not
whether he had an Army left. All his Generals
were killed or wounded, all his cannon taken, the
flower of his troops slaughtered or dispersed: yet,
in those circumstances he made so able a retreat, so
assiduously reassembled the remains of his Army,
and chose his ground in so masterly a manner, that
the Russians not only did not venture to make any
attempt on Berlin, but drew no advantages from so
complete a victory. Even Marshal Daun, who had
selected the very moment for deciding the King’s
ruin, improved the conjuncture with far less capacity
than the vanquished Prince, who seemed to have
no resource left. The Marshal, instead of being
born, as men conjectured, to weary out the fertility
of that monarch’s genius, seemed at last but the
proper touchstone for proving the extent of his
abilities. In a second note to his Queen, his Majesty
ordered her to remove from Berlin with the
Royal Family; the archives to be transported to
Potsdam. The capital, he added, might make conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
with the enemy. This was the first thought&mdash;yet
he not only saved Berlin; but though Marshal
Daun joined Soltikoff, and though the King
received two more defeats during the course of the
campaign, yet by the dexterous manœuvres of his
brother, Prince Henry, whose military talents the
King professed to prefer to his own, and who drew
the Marshal towards Saxony by a daring and celebrated
march, by the retreat of the Russians, to
which the King forced them, and by the too deliberate
councils of the Austrian chief, who continued
to act in a defensive style even after he
had reduced the King to the last gasp, that Prince
was still saved to baffle the reasonings of the speculative,
and to terminate his glorious career in a
manner worthy of its progress.</p>

<p>While the war seemed drawing towards a conclusion
in the North, it looked as if fate was opening
a new source of calamities to mankind. Ferdinand
King of Spain died; a Prince of no abilities,
and lately of disordered intellects. His want of issue
had formerly been imputed to drugs administered
to him by the practices of his mother-in-law, Elizabeth
Farnese, the politic Queen-dowager. Men of
a suspicious cast might attribute his frenzy to the
same cause; but a more pregnant reason might be
assigned. His father, who certainly was far from
being afflicted with any bodily debility, had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
equally disturbed in his understanding. Ferdinand’s
Queen,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> who had great ascendant over him,
had kept his madness within bounds. On her
death nobody had any influence with him. His
disorder, thus left to itself, increased, and put an
end to his life about a year after the decease of his
Queen.</p>

<p>The Queen-dowager, though not absolute directress
of affairs during the life of her son-in-law,
had yet, from her intrigues, bribes, and dependents,
and still more from the visible and approaching
prospect of her own son’s succession, acquired much
authority, though not enough to throw the kingdom,
as she wished, into direct connexion with
France. The probability of the weight she would
have with her son Don Carlos; the power his own
Queen, who was a daughter of Saxony, was known
to have with him; and the subjection in which we
had held him while only King of Naples&mdash;all these
motives concurred to lead him into French measures.
Naples, by the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle,
had been destined to his brother the Duke of Parma.
Don Carlos, indeed, had never given his consent to
that disposition: he was less inclined to conform
to it when the forces of Spain enabled him to dispute
it. Accordingly, on obtaining the Spanish
Crown, he destined that of Naples to one of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
younger sons. The eldest, called Duke of Calabria,
and heir-apparent of Spain, inherited the weakness
of mind of his grandfather and uncle. Him, therefore,
it was determined totally to set aside. Solemnity
was used in proceeding to that rejection.
The young Prince, then thirteen, was formally examined
by physicians. One<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> of them was so honest
as to refuse to sign his persuasion of the Prince’s
incapacity, though at length he too yielded. The
case was novel and striking. Just, undoubtedly,
to the people who were to be governed: but many
favourers of hereditary right&mdash;that is, men who
think that no want of talents or virtues ought to
exclude a Prince from exercising that office which
requires the noblest share of both, and hold that
mankind, like land, ought to be the property of
birth&mdash;will not be pleased with the reasons which
the Neapolitan physicians were of opinion disqualified
the Prince for the throne of Spain.</p>

<p>“He was short, his joints were contracted, he
stooped, looked down, squinted, was sometimes indifferent
to things convenient for him, at others too
warm and impetuous. His passions not restrained
by reason; he had an obstinate aversion to sweetmeats;
was disturbed by all sorts of noise; pain or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
pleasure made no lasting impressions on him; he
was utterly unacquainted with good-breeding; had
not the least idea of the mysteries of their holy
religion; loved childish amusements, the most
boisterous the best; and was continually shifting
from one thing to another.”</p>

<p>If these defects were disqualifications, hard would
be the fate of most sovereigns! how seldom would
an eldest son succeed his father! Would not one
think that the faculty of physic at Naples had
rather been describing a Monarch than dispossessing
him? One thing is evident&mdash;it must have
been a King who selected <em>such</em> criterions for judging
whether his son was capable of governing a
great nation. “Ask him,” we must suppose, said
his Neapolitan Majesty, “whether he loves sweetmeats!
if he does not, he is unworthy of filling the
Throne of his ancestors.” The Prince’s ignorance
of good-breeding and of his religion seems rather
imputable to his parents and preceptors than to
him. If it were the mysteries of the Roman Catholic
faith which he was incapable of comprehending, I
should suspect the Prince was a sensible lad. Perhaps
the honest physician thought as I do&mdash;at least,
I do not doubt but, if permitted, he would have
asked the Prince other questions.</p>

<p>Voltaire, who, I do not know why, thinks Princes
are always to be mentioned with strict decorum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
could hardly persuade any man to refrain from
laughing at this absurd catalogue of royal deficiencies.
The Prince really was an idiot; nor was it
likely that a father would wish to disinherit his own
child, especially who was not old enough to have
given him jealousy, unless the incapacity had been
glaring and hopeless&mdash;but one would think the
whole Cabinet of Naples had been idiots likewise,
when they could find no better colours to dress up
a notorious fact. Indeed, the Spanish as well as
Portuguese statesmen have been wofully defective
in composition in this age, as often as they have
attempted to lay the grounds of their proceedings
before the rest of Europe. The most barbarous
periods of monkish ignorance and despotism produced
nothing more despicable than several manifestos
of those Crowns.</p>

<p>The Prince was set aside in consequence of the
decision of the physicians.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The second son was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>carried to Spain and declared Prince of Asturias.
To the third was actually resigned the Crown of
Naples, though too young to have it known whether
he was more fit to reign than his eldest brother&mdash;but
a baby is never thought disqualified. The
tranquillity, however, of that child’s reign depended
so much on preserving the friendship of England,
that the new King of Spain was not impatient to
hurry into French councils. His wife too had prepossessed
him with apprehensions of being governed
by his mother. The Crown of Naples, which he
had owed entirely to her intrigues, could not induce
him to put that of Spain under her direction. She
could not even obtain to see him alone&mdash;a mortifying
return from a darling son, who had been absent
from her thirty years! But if the new Queen in
that instance showed her influence, she lost it in
every other. The King was extremely weak, but
unmeasurably obstinate. The Crown of Spain, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
probably some Spanish Minister, infused into him
higher thoughts of himself. He grew jealous of his
wife’s ascendant, sent away a Neapolitan Duchess
who governed her, and took a resolution of deciding
everything by his own judgment. He could not
have chosen a worse counsellor.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> The disgraces that
soon attended his measures made the true Spaniards
wish that the Neapolitan doctors had been consulted
on more cases than one.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>
<p>The death of King Ferdinand was followed (September
4) by that of the Lady Elizabeth of England,
second daughter of Frederic, Prince of Wales, in
her eighteenth year. She had the quickest parts
of any of his children, but was extremely deformed
and homely. She died at Kew, of an inflammation
in her bowels, having been ill but two days.</p>

<p>The beginning of the same month was distinguished
by a torrent of prosperous news. The
French fleet had sailed from Toulon. Admiral
Boscawen<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> was refitting his squadron at Gibraltar,
an inaction of which they hoped to profit, but the
alertness of our commander demolished their hopes.
On notice of their approach, he sailed out, and came
up with the French off Cape Lagos, in Portugal.
They made a running fight, but could not escape
the vigilance and bravery of Boscawen. Two of
their largest ships were taken; two others forced on
shore and burnt; in one of which was the Commander,
who was wounded in both legs, and expired
soon after. The action passed on the 18th of
August.</p>

<p>At the same time we learnt the conquest of Niagara
by Sir William Johnson, the provincial hero.
The account was carried to General Amherst on
the very day on which he took possession of Ticonderoga<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and Crown Point, abandoned by the French.
It had been the plan to attack all the strong posts
of the French at once. Amherst<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> had the command
in chief; and, by the river St. Lawrence, was
to fall on Quebec on one side, while the expedition
under Wolfe and Saunders was to undertake the
siege on the other. The conduct of that against
Niagara was committed to General Prideaux, who
was killed in the trenches by the bursting of a cohorn.
Sir William Johnson, on whom the command
devolved, took the place, after beating an army of
French and Indians sent to relieve it.</p>

<p>Amid such a tide of success Lord George Sackville
arrived in London. He immediately wrote
to Lord Holderness to demand a Court-Martial.
The demand was evaded for the present. He was
told, the officers necessary were employed abroad.
Lord Ligonier, the Commander-in-Chief, and Lord
Barrington, Secretary at War, were more explicit,
and informed him, that if he desired a Court-Martial,
he must seek it in Germany. This was
followed by a message, delivered by the latter, acquainting
Lord George, that not only the command
of his regiment would be taken from him, but that
he would be dismissed from his rank of General,
and from his post of Lieutenant-General of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Ordnance; and Lord Barrington asked civilly if his
Lordship chose to receive that notification then
from his mouth, or in writing! Lord George
preferred the latter. “That,” replied Lord Barrington,
“will be easy; for I know but one precedent,
that of the late Lord Cobham. I will send
your Lordship the same.” Lord George smiled,
and replied, “I hope your Lordship will send me
a copy of Lord Cobham’s answer, too.”</p>

<p>This behaviour of the Court was not very intelligible,
many even thought it had been concerted,
as the gentlest way of letting Lord George escape.
Certain it is, that their avoiding to call him to a
trial made him presume on his cause, and resolve
to try to correct the severity of his fortune. On
the other hand, the punishment seemed too rigid to
a man untried, uncondemned, who asked a trial,
and against whom no complaint was preferred in
form. He had even, a fortnight after his disgrace,
written to Prince Ferdinand to know his charge.
The latter protested he had no complaint against
him, nor had written a word in his disfavour,
<em>till</em> on hearing the discourses in the camp. Tenderness
to so old a servant as the Duke of Dorset,
perhaps, made the King willing to avoid the last
severity, which, should Lord George be condemned,
would be difficult to avoid. The officers of the
Fleet, who had seen an example made in their profession,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
would exclaim against partiality to a land
officer, the greatness of whose birth would be the
obvious cause of such lenity.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt, too, was of no sanguinary complexion,
though a rigid exactor of obedience. From the
first moment of Lord George’s disgrace, Mr. Pitt
warmly adopted the sentiments of Prince Ferdinand,
whom he was determined heartily to support.
Though he went to visit Lord George in form, he
by no means meant to protect him. He would not,
he said, condemn any man unheard. But he was
sworn to the German cause, and to the heroes whose
success reflected such lustre on his own Administration,
and concurred so much to give it stability. When
Fitzroy returned to the Army, Mr. Pitt charged
him with the strongest assurances to Prince Ferdinand
(as Fitzroy told Mr. Conway): “Tell him,”
said Mr. Pitt, “he shall have what reinforcements,
what ammunition, he pleases&mdash;tell him I will stand
or fall with him.” Hearing, too, that Lord Mansfield
connected with Lord George, and the Law
intended to support him, “The Law,” said Pitt,
“have nothing to do with that question.” Lord
Granby succeeded Lord George Sackville in the
Ordnance, and General Waldegrave in the regiment.
Lord George published a short address, intreating
the nation to suspend their opinion till he could
have an opportunity of clearing himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>In this month of September died Dr. Madox,
Bishop of Worcester, a man who, from very low
beginnings, and with no visible address, had raised
himself to great height in the Church; and which
at that time was singular, he never pushed his fortune
through the Duke of Newcastle. He had
higher merit&mdash;assiduously promoting regulations to
prevent the destructive vices of the common people.
He was succeeded by Johnson of Gloucester, who
has been much mentioned in these Memoirs on a
particular occasion.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

but never attained any degree of understanding. He was
allowed to take the air in his coach constantly and publicly,
and every body could perceive his insensibility. The next
Prince, become Prince of Asturias,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> was violent and brutal.
The third, King of Naples, was not void of symptoms of the
malady of his family, though it was doubtful whether his intellects
were weak or deranged. Like his father, he was
indefatigable in hunting, and passed many more hours of
every day with his dogs than with his Ministers&mdash;such a
sinecure is royalty! Had the eldest Prince been capable of
passing his whole time in hunting, he might have been King.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_66_66" id="Footnote_66_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_66_66"><span class="label">[66]</span></a> Our author treats Charles III. with undue severity. He
was no hero or statesman, but yet not devoid of good
qualities. Probity, justice, consistency, and humanity, were
among his virtues. On his accession to the Crown of Spain
he submitted to great inconvenience, from a principle of
honesty&mdash;he deemed it wrong to divert any portion of the
treasure of Naples from the service of that kingdom; and he
adhered so religiously to his scruple, that he not only left the
public funds untouched, but divested himself of all private
wealth, even to pictures, gems, and rings, considering them
as the property of the people whose resources had enabled
him to purchase them. He engaged, indeed, in two wars&mdash;one
manifestly unjust, and both perhaps unnecessary; but he
protected literature and the arts of peace. Though a bigoted
Catholic, he suppressed the Jesuits, abolished, or at least discountenanced,
torture, and mitigated religious persecution by
his neglect and dislike of the Inquisition. In short, few absolute
Kings, and none of his race and country, have been
more free from the reproach of extravagance, injustice, or inhumanity.
His reign was less oppressive and less inglorious
than any under which Spain languished during the long suspension
or evasion of her ancient free institutions.&mdash;E.</p></div>

<p>Prince Ferdinand reaped as little advantage
from his success at Minden as the enemies had from
the defeat of the King of Prussia. The French
Army was still superior. Contades had so entirely
lost his credit, that Marshal D’Etrées, against his
own inclination, was sent to share the command,
and at least warded off any new disgrace to his
country. Yet so sunk were both their Councils and
Commanders in the estimation of the public, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
so much of the national shame was attributed to
the influence of Madame de Pompadour, that a description
of their situation and of the supposed
cause was fixed upon the walls of Versailles, in these
words,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
<p class="verseq">“Bateaux plats à vendre,</p>

<p class="noindent">But the measure of their disgraces was not yet
complete. They were foiled in the East Indies, as
in all other parts. Lally, their General, a man of
great parts and impetuosity, but with both the
high and the low talents of an adventurer, was forced
to raise the siege, which he had undertaken, of Madras,
and resigned his command in indignation at
the cowardice of his countrymen. Admiral Pococke
twice beat their Fleet. Their invasions on the Ohio
cost them the second empire which they had so artfully
and so silently been founding at the other end
of the world.</p>

<p>The joy on those successes, however, was damped
by a desponding letter received from General Wolfe
before Quebec, on the 14th of October. He had
found the enterprise infinitely more difficult than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
he had conceived, the country strong from every
circumstance of situation: the French had a superior
Army, had called in every Canadian capable of
bearing arms: twenty-two ship-loads of provisions
had escaped Admiral Durell, and got into the town;
Amherst was not come up: and, above all, Montcalm,
the French General, had shown that he understood
the natural strength of the country, had
posted himself in the most advantageous situation,
and was not to be drawn from it by any stratagem
which Wolfe, assisted by the steady co-operation of
our Fleet, could put in practice. Wolfe, himself,
was languishing with the stone, and a complication
of disorders, which fatigue and disappointment had
brought upon him. Townshend<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and other officers
had crossed him in his plans, but he had not
yielded. Himself had been one of the warmest
censurers of the miscarried expedition to Rochfort;
and he had received this high command upon the
assurance that no dangers or difficulties should discourage
him. His Army wasted before his eyes by
sickness; the season advanced fast which must put
an end to his attempts: he had no choice remaining
but in variety of difficulties. In the most artful
terms that could be framed he left the nation uncertain
whether he meaned to prepare an excuse for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
desisting, or to claim the melancholy merit of
having sacrificed himself without a prospect of
success.</p>

<p>Three days after, an express arrived that Quebec
was taken&mdash;a conquest heightened by the preceding
gloom and despair. The rapidity with which our
arms had prevailed in every quarter of the globe
made us presume that Canada could not fail of being
added to our acquisitions; and however arduously
won, it would have sunk in value, if the transient
cloud that overcast the dawn of this glory had not
made it burst forth with redoubled lustre. The
incidents of dramatic fiction could not be conducted
with more address to lead an audience from despondency
to sudden exultation, than accident prepared
to excite the passions of a whole people.
They despaired&mdash;they triumphed&mdash;and they wept&mdash;for
Wolfe had fallen in the hour of victory! Joy,
grief, curiosity, astonishment, were painted in every
countenance: the more they inquired, the higher
their admiration rose. Not an incident but was
heroic and affecting!</p>

<p>Wolfe, between persuasion of the impracticability,
unwillingness to leave any attempt untried that
could be proposed, and worn out with the anxiety
of mind and body, had determined to make one last
effort above the town. He embarked his forces at
one in the morning, and passed the French sentinels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
in silence, that were posted along the shore. The
current carried them beyond the destined spot.
They found themselves at the foot of a precipice,
esteemed so impracticable, that only a slight guard
of one hundred and fifty men defended it. Had
there been a path, the night was too dark to discover
it. The troops, whom nothing could discourage,
for these difficulties could not, pulled themselves
and one another up by stumps and boughs of trees.
The guard, hearing a rustling, fired down the precipice
at random, as our men did up into the air:
but, terrified by the strangeness of the attempt, the
French picquet fled&mdash;all but the Captain, who,
though wounded, would not accept quarter, but
fired at one of our officers at the head of five hundred
men. This, as he staked but a single life, was
thought such an unfair war, that, instead of
honouring his desperate valour, our men, to punish
him, cut off his croix de St. Louis before they sent
him to the hospital. Two of our officers, however,
signed a certificate of his courage, lest the French
should punish him as corrupted; our enterprise,
unless facilitated by corruption, being deemed impossible
to have taken place.</p>

<p>Day-break discovered our forces in possession of
the eminence. Montcalm could not credit it when
reported to him; but it was too late to doubt when
nothing but a battle could save the town. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
then he held our attempt so desperate, that, being
shown the position of the English, he said, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui,
je les vois où ils ne doivent pas être</i>.” Forced to
quit his entrenchments, he said, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">S’il faut donc
combattre, je vais les écraser</i>.” He prepared for
engagement, after lining the bushes with detachments
of Indians. Our men, according to orders,
reserved their fire with a patience and tranquillity
equal to the resolution they had exerted in clambering
the precipice&mdash;but when they gave it, it took place
with such terrible slaughter of the enemy, that half
an hour decided the day. The French fled precipitately;
and Montcalm, endeavouring to rally them,
was killed on the spot. General Monckton<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> was
wounded early, and obliged to retire.</p>

<p>The fall of Wolfe was noble indeed. He received
a wound in the head, but covered it from his soldiers
with his handkerchief. A second ball struck
him in the belly: that too he dissembled. A third
hitting him in the breast, he sunk under the anguish,
and was carried behind the ranks. Yet, fast as life
ebbed out, his whole anxiety centred on the fortune
of the day. He begged to be borne nearer to the
action; but his sight being dimmed by the approach
of death, he entreated to be told what they who
supported him saw: he was answered that the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
gave ground. He eagerly repeated the question,
heard the enemy was totally routed, cried “I am
satisfied”&mdash;and expired.</p>

<p>In five days the town capitulated. Wolfe dead,
and Monckton disabled, General Townshend signed
the articles. He, and his friends for him, even
attempted to ravish the honour of the conquest from
Wolfe. Townshend’s first letter said nothing in
praise of him. In one to the Speaker of the House
of Commons he went so far as indirectly to assume
the glory of the last effort. The words were these,
“We determined on the 13th of September to do
what we ought to have done in the beginning: but
in military operations it is never too late to reform.”
In other more private dispatches Townshend was
still more explicit. These he ordered to be shown
to the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Newcastle, and
Mr. Pitt. From the first he received great assurances
of countenance&mdash;but the passion of gratitude with
which the nation was transported towards Wolfe’s
memory overbore all attempts to lessen his fame.
It was not by surviving him that he could be
eclipsed.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Vaudreuil, Governor of the province,
had appeared at the close of the engagement, but,
seeing his countrymen defeated, retired to Montreal.
Had he fallen into our hands, our men were determined
to scalp him, he having been the chief and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
blackest author of the cruelties exercised on our
countrymen. Some of his letters were taken, in
which he explicitly and basely said, that “Peace
was the best time for making war on the English.”
Such perfidy, and such barbarism as was contained
in the dispatches of Marshal Belleisle, mentioned
before, affix a stain on a nation which it requires an
age of generous heroism to wash out. The cruelties
exercised in the Palatinate by Louis XIV. conjured
up that storm which overwhelmed the end of his
reign, and enjoined the humiliating proposal of
obliging him to concur in dethroning his own
grandson. When ambition is inhuman, and tyranny
insolent, they double the bitterness of a reverse of
fortune by having given a precedent of wanton
indignities.</p>

<p>The repeated misfortunes of France, and the efforts
they had made without effect to bring the war to
some tolerable conclusion, reduced them at last to a
state of bankruptcy; a kind of evidence which even
their future historians will not be able to parry.
Defeated Armies frequently claim the victory, but
no nation ever sung <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i> on becoming insolvent.
Three arrêts were published by the Court of
France in October, suspending for a year the payment
of the orders upon the general receipts of the
finances, and allowing five per cent. on the respective
sums as an indemnification. The second, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
same tenour with respect to the hills of the general
farms; and the third suspending the reimbursement
of capitals, as well in regard to the treasury as to
the redemption-fund.</p>

<p>This stoppage<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> gave rise to a stroke of humour in
the English newspapers, which, in the list of bankrupts,
inserted these words, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Louis le Petit</i>, of the
City of Paris, peace-breaker, dealer, and chapman.”</p>

<p>Monsieur Thurot, in the meanwhile, who had
escaped our Fleet, arrived at Gottenburgh; it was
then supposed with an intention of taking some
Swedish forces on board, and invading some part of
Scotland or Ireland. Mr. Pitt thinking too little
attention was paid in Ireland to this project, wrote
to the Duke of Bedford to notify the suspicions entertained
here on that head. The Duke too rashly
communicated that intelligence to the Irish parliament,
and his son, the Marquis of Tavistock, moved
them to arm. The consequence was, that the
bankers there took the alarm, and stopped payment.</p>

<p>The English Parliament met October 13th.
Beckford, by a high-flown encomium on Mr. Pitt,
paved the way for that Minister to open on his own
and our situation, which he did with great address,
seeming to waive any merit, but stating our success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
in a manner that excluded all others from a share
in it. He disclaimed particular praise, and professed
his determination of keeping united with the
rest of the Ministers. Fidelity and diligence were
all he could boast, though his bad health perhaps
had caused him to relax somewhat of his application.
Not a week, he said, had passed in the summer
but had been a crisis, in which he had not
known whether he should be torn in pieces, or commended,
as he was now by Mr. Beckford. That
the more a man was versed in business, the more he
found the hand of Providence everywhere. That
success had given us unanimity, not unanimity
success. That for himself, however, he could not
have dared, as he had done, but in these times.
Other Ministers had hoped as well, but had not
been circumstanced (not so popular) to dare as
much. (This was handsome to them, yet appropriated
the whole merit to himself.) He thought
the stone almost rolled to the top of the hill, but it
might roll back with dreadful repercussion. A
weak moment in the field, or in council, might overturn
all; for there was no such thing as chance;
<em>it was the unaccountable name of Nothing</em>. All
was Providence, whose favour was to be merited by
virtue. Our Allies must be supported: if one
wheel stopped, all might. He had unlearned his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
juvenile errors, and thought no longer that England
could do all by itself; (This was an indirect
apology for having embraced the German system;
and what followed on the invasion was perhaps an
artful method of soliciting more troops, which once
voted, might be sent abroad)&mdash;<em>who had never
been subject to a panic, was not likely to be terrified
now</em>.</p>

<p>He stated Prince Ferdinand’s Army as containing
but 60,000 effective men: France, the next
year, would have an hundred thousand&mdash;was Prince
Ferdinand, therefore, as strong as we wished him?
He did wish 10,000 more could be found for him;
believed France meaned to invade us, though he
should not look on the attempt as dangerous if she did.
He balanced his attention between the landed and the
monied interest; said, he did not prefer the monied
men and the eighty millions in the Funds to the
landed interest, though he thought our complaisance
for the former ought to increase as public credit
became more delicate. He ended with a mention
of peace. Anybody, he said, could advise him in
war: who could draw such a peace as would please
everybody? He would snatch at the first moment
of peace; though he wished he could leave off at
the war. This conclusion seemed to come from his
heart, and perhaps escaped him without design.
Though no man knew so well how to say what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
pleased, no man ever knew so little what he was
going to say.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Lord Buckingham moved the Address in the
Lords, and flung in much panegyric on George
Townshend; whose friends were now reduced to
compose and publish in his name a letter in praise
of Wolfe. The Ministers had proposed that the
Address of the Commons should be moved by
Charles Townshend, the nearness of whose connection
would exclude him from being profuse <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'on his his brother'">on his
brother</ins>: but he refused, on finding how little
incense was intended to be offered to their name.</p>

<p>The unanimity in the Government which Mr.
Pitt had advertised was far from solid. It was not
the fault of one man’s vanity that it was not dissolved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Lord Temple, taking advantage of the
adoration which the nation paid to Mr. Pitt, asked&mdash;considering
the moment, it may be said demanded&mdash;the
Garter; and being refused, abruptly resigned
the Privy Seal. The insult, in effect, was to the
nation: it was saying, “I will have that I will, or
here end your victories; Mr. Pitt shall serve you
no more.” It was sacrificing largely to friendship
and gratitude that Mr. Pitt did not reckon himself
deeply insulted too. An ascendant so notified
could not be endured by many men. What if
Antony had said to Cæsar, “Abandon the conquest
of Gaul, if I am not allowed to wear a chaplet of
laurel!”</p>

<p>Two days afterwards, the King commissioned
the Duke of Devonshire to persuade Lord Temple
to resume his place: some civil hints towards a
promise of the Garter were added. Lord Temple
finding his resignation received by the world with
due indignation, was not obdurate, and kissed
hands again for the Privy Seal. He pretended to
Lord Hertford, that finding himself ill-treated by
the King, he had asked for the Garter as an indication
of returning favour; that his suit being
rejected, he had begged an audience, in which he
hoped he had effaced his Majesty’s ill impressions;
and in which audience the King had three times
pressed him to reconsider his resolution of retiring:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
that he had entreated Mr. Pitt to resent nothing
on his account; and had insisted on his brothers
retaining their places, and continuing to support
the Government, as he should himself: that he was
then going out of town the most contented man in
England. This passed before his resumption of the
Seal. To others he denied having asked the
Garter. He obtained it shortly after this violence.</p>

<p>On the 21st, Mr. Pitt moved the House of Commons
to order a monument for General Wolfe; and,
in a low and plaintive voice, pronounced a kind of
funeral oration. It was, perhaps, the worst harangue
he ever uttered. His eloquence was too
native not to suffer by being crowded into a ready-prepared
mould. The parallels which he drew from
Greek and Roman story did but flatten the pathetic
of the topic. Mr. Pitt himself had done more for
Britain than any orator for Rome. Our three last
campaigns had over-run more world than they
conquered in a century&mdash;and for the Grecians, their
story were a pretty theme if the town of St. Albans
were waging war with that of Brentford. The
horror of the night, the precipice scaled by Wolfe,
the empire he with a handful of men added to
England, and the glorious catastrophe of contentedly
terminating life where his fame began&mdash;ancient
story may be ransacked, and ostentatious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
philosophy thrown into the account, before an
episode can be found to rank with Wolfe’s.</p>

<p>Beckford commended General Townshend, and
hoped some thanks would be given to those who
completed the conquest. Sir William Williams
enlarged on the praise of Wolfe. Lord North, in a
more manly style, said it was a proof of Mr. Pitt’s
abilities, that they sat there securely discerning
rewards, while the French Fleet was sailed from
Brest. For Wolfe he had paid his debt of expectation.
Pitt then moved, in general words, for
thanks to the Generals and Admirals; mentioned
them all, particularly Admiral Saunders,
whose merit, he said, had equalled those who have
beaten Armadas&mdash;“May I anticipate?” cried he,
“those who <em>will</em> beat Armadas!” He expatiated
more largely on Townshend, who, he said, had gone
unrequested whither the invited never came. This
was far from being strictly the fact. Townshend
had gone unwillingly; sent even, as was believed,
by Mr. Pitt, who wished to get rid of so troublesome
a man. George Grenville put an end to the
day in an affecting manner; mentioning the death
of his younger brother Thomas, who, in <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'the preceeding war'">the preceding
war</ins>, had fallen with expressions of content<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
on a day of victory.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. Pitt’s anticipation of Saunders’s renown <em>was</em>
prophetic. That Admiral was a pattern of most
steady bravery, united with the most unaffected
modesty. No man said less or deserved more.
Simplicity in his manners, generosity, and good-nature,
adorned his genuine love of his country.
His services at Quebec had been eminent. Returning
thence, he heard that Monsieur Conflans
had taken the opportunity of Sir Edward Hawke’s
retiring to Gibraltar to refit, and had sailed out
of Brest. Saunders, who heard the news at Plymouth,
far from thinking he had done enough,
turned back instantaneously, and sailed to assist
Hawke. His patriotism dictated that step, and
would not wait for other orders. He arrived too
late&mdash;but a moment so embraced could not be
accounted lost. Such, too, was the age, that
England did not want the addition of a Saunders!</p>

<p>That prudent and active officer, Sir Edward
Hawke, had sailed on the first notice to seek the
French squadron. He had twenty-three ships,
they twenty-one. He came up with them on their
own coast; and, before half his Fleet had joined
him, began the attack. Conflans at first made a
show of fighting, but soon took the part of endeavouring
to shelter himself among the rocks, of
which that coast is full. It was the 20th of November:
the shortness of the day prevented the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
total demolition of the enemy&mdash;but darkness nor
a dreadful tempest that ensued could call off Sir
Edward from pursuing his blow. The roaring of
the elements was redoubled by the thunder from
our ships; and both concurred in that scene of
horror, to put a period to the Navy and hopes of
France. Seven ships of the line got into the river
Vilaine, eight more escaped to different ports.
Conflans’ own ship and another were run on shore
and burnt. One we took. Two of ours were lost
in the storm, but the crews saved. Lord Howe,
who attacked the Formidable, bore down on her
with such violence, that her prow forced in his
lower tier of guns. Captain Digby,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> in the Dunkirk,
received the fire of twelve of the enemy’s
ships, and lost not a man. Keppel’s was full of
water, and he thought it sinking: a sudden squall
emptied his ship, but he was informed all his powder
was wet&mdash;“Then,” said he, “I am sorry I am
safe.” They came and told him a small quantity
was undamaged&mdash;“Very well,” said he; “then
attack again.” Not above eight of our ships were
engaged in obtaining that decisive victory. The
invasion was heard of no more, but in a puny
episode that will be mentioned hereafter. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
in agitation, it was expected that the people would
call for the Duke of Cumberland to command.
The Duchess of Bedford told him of the rumour.
“I do not believe, madam,” replied the Prince,
“that the command will be offered to me, but
when no wise man would accept it, and no honest
man would refuse it.”</p>

<p>The Parliament in the meantime had sat on the
Army for the future year, and a new case had appeared
before the Committee of the Commons.
Lord Downe,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Lord Pulteney,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and Sir William
Peere Williams, had received general commissions
to act as officers, yet their seats in Parliament had
not been declared vacant. As this seemed an innovation,
and contrary to the usage of the House of
Commons, Sir John Philipps desired to have the
case explained. Lord Downe, he said, he knew had
received a brevet, that if taken prisoner, he might
be entitled to the benefit of the cartel. Sir William
Williams took upon him to explain it: declared he
had no pay, never would accept pay, and had only
a commission to raise men, as his zeal had prompted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>him to do. Mr. Fox asked, how he came then to
be employed in any particular regiment? He replied
readily, though his usual manner was formal, that
he acted only by the regimental book at Northampton.
Lord Barrington urged for Lord Downe, who was
in Germany, that he acted only as Deputy Lieutenant-Colonel,
another person receiving the pay. Favour
to those three disinterested young men obtained the
connivance of the House, though the case indubitably
was unparliamentary. The partiality of
the Tories to George Townshend, who, having
quitted the service during the command of the Duke
of Cumberland, had again lately entered into it, and
accepted a regiment, was still more remarkable. As
no evasion could except him from the law, his case
was not mentioned, and he continued to enjoy his
seat without a re-election.</p>

<p>Lord Barrington then opened the state of the
Army, which, including 18,000 Militia, would
amount to above 175,000 men in British pay. Sir
John Philipps again glanced at new regiments and
extraordinary commissions. Mr. Pitt avowed the
measure for his own, and owned he would have carried
it further, if he had been permitted: related
how he had been pleased with the behaviour of
Colonel Hale, who had brought the news of the conquest
of Quebec; and who finding an invasion threatened,
and himself at a distance from his regiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
had offered to form a corps of the footmen and
chairmen of London, and lead them against the
best household troops of France. For the economic
part, to push expense was the best economy&mdash;for
blood, we had lost none; never had been so bloodless
a war; not fifteen hundred men had fallen in
America. That the city of London had raised more
men than Ireland in a twelvemonth. He hoped it
would be related to the Irish Parliament that they
had been censured in the English. He did justice
to the merit of General Amherst, whose campaign,
if in Vegetius, all the world would admire: it was
in America, and nobody regarded it. He dwelt on
Amherst’s letters to the provinces, exhorting, encouraging,
and commanding their efforts for the
common cause. He painted France in a state of
bankruptcy and despondence; and their attempts
as rather those of a dying than living monarchy.
On this topic he made a fine conclusion&mdash;and the
battle of Minden was not forgotten.</p>

<p>So much given to glory, something was to be done
that might look like moderation. Europe began to
take umbrage at our success: but, sailing with prosperity,
Mr. Pitt did not trouble himself whether
Europe’s voice went along with his achievements.
It was the nation that he had made so great, that
must be allured to approve his further enterprises.
General Yorke, at the Hague, had received some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
anonymous proposals of peace, and had transmitted
them to his father, who communicated them to the
Duke of Newcastle. The latter mentioned them to
Knyphausen, the Prussian Minister, who, though enjoined
to secrecy, revealed them to Lord Holderness.
The latter, who had quitted Newcastle for Pitt, instantly
carried the intelligence to his new patron.
Pitt, enraged to find a kind of negotiation carrying
on without the participation of either Secretary,
reproached Newcastle in warm terms. The latter
threw the blame on General Yorke. Pitt, however,
thought it prudent (whether to have the honour of
the treaty, or an opportunity of breaking it off) to
direct General Yorke, in the name of his own King
and of the King of Prussia, to acquaint Prince Lewis
of Brunswick, who commanded the forces of Holland,
and through him Monsieur D’Affry, the French
Minister at the Hague, and the Ministers of Spain
and Russia, that, notwithstanding our victories, we
were willing to listen to terms of peace, if France
would specify her proposals&mdash;an overture that ended
in air. Nor did any subsequent step of Mr. Pitt
speak him cordial to the business of peace. “I
have been told,” he said, “that some time before
he should have been well contented to bring France
on her knees; now he would not rest till he had laid
her on her back.”</p>

<p>During these events of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</i>, an incident happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
that led to a discovery of some of the secret
politics of the Heir-Apparent’s Court. A seat for
the county of Hampshire was become vacant, the
Marquis of Winchester,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> one of its members, succeeding
his father in the Dukedom. Legge, about
the same time, had likewise vacated his seat for the
same county, a patent-place devolving to him by the
death of his brother. Lord Bute took that opportunity
of notifying his resentment to Legge, who
stood for the county, and carried it against one
Stewart,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> recommended by the Earl. Pitt did not
favour Legge; and was as little inclined to favour
the views of the Prince’s Court. Their mutual
haughtiness and reserve had early impaired the connexion
of Lord Bute and Pitt. The Prince’s Court
had secrets of their own; nor was Pitt more communicative
to the successor of his grandfather’s
measures. The affair of Lord George Sackville,
who was patronized by the Prince, widened the
breach.</p>

<p>Rewards were now bestowed on the meritorious
Commanders. Sir Edward Hawke, a man void of
ostentation or ambition, was rewarded with an annual
pension of 1500<em>l.</em> for thirty years. Admiral Boscawen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>was made General of Marines, and Saunders
Lieutenant-General; the former with 5<em>l.</em> a day, the
latter with 4<em>l.</em> A present of twenty thousand pounds
was given to Prince Ferdinand by the King, but
brought into the House of Commons with other
charges of the year. Sir John Philipps, obliquely
to make the King’s parsimony remarked, who had
made a present to his General at the expense of his
people, found fault with the manner, and said that
the gift of the House ought to have been transacted
in a handsomer manner. Pitt took the advice on
himself, and descanted on the merit of the Prince,
who had served us for two years without pay;
talked on the rewards to the Duke of Marlborough;
and quoted Lord Stair for having in one article
charged 40,000<em>l.</em> for putting the Austrians in
motion. But neither was the present itself blamed,
nor could the Prince be said to have served for
nothing. Twelve thousand pounds a year were paid
to him for his table and stables: he had the Garter,
and a pension of two thousand a year on Ireland.
If he suffered his German agents to embezzle millions
without accounting with him, he had less <em>prudence</em>
than the Duke of Marlborough&mdash;and yet did not
escape similar suspicions.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the year, Nugent was made
Vice Treasurer of Ireland, on the death of Potter,
and was succeeded in the Treasury by Oswald.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Pitt, in contradiction to the House of Manners, who
solicited for Dr. Ewer, to Newcastle, who stickled
for a Cambridge man, and to the opposition of the
Episcopal Bench, made Warburton Bishop of Gloucester;
whose doubtful Christianity, whose writings
and turbulent arrogance, made him generally obnoxious.
Warburton, inquiring of a friend what
the Clergy thought of his promotion, and being told
how much it offended them, said, “Tell them it
was well for their cause that I did not embrace any
other profession.”&mdash;We must now take a view of
another scene.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt, as I have said, had endeavoured to
instil apprehensions of an invasion into the Irish
Parliament; at least, to encourage a spirit of raising
troops, which might afterwards be applied to other
services. It happened at that juncture that there
was another point which alarmed the Irish more
than the rumours of invasion. This was a jealousy
that an union with England was intended, which
they regarded as the means of subjecting them further
to this Crown. This union was, indeed, a
favourite object with Lord Hilsborough. He had
hinted such a wish a year or two before in the Parliament
of England; and being now in Ireland, let
drop expressions of the same tendency. This was
no sooner divulged than Dublin was in a flame.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
The mob grew outrageous, and assembled at the
door of the House of Commons. Mr. Rigby<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> went
forth and assured them there was no foundation for
their jealousy; but <em>his</em> word they would not take.
Ponsonby, the Speaker, was at last obliged to go
out and pacify them; and Mr. Rigby declared in
the House, that if a Bill of Union was brought in,
he would vote against it. The tumult then subsided;
but Rigby soon after, in consequence of the
representations from England, moving that the Lord
Lieutenant might on an emergency, such as on an
invasion, summon the Parliament to meet without
an intervention of forty days, the former suspicions
revived, and Rigby’s motion was interpreted as preparatory
to some sudden scheme of union before
measures could be taken to oppose it. The surmise
was absurd; for were any surprise intended, the
forms are so many before a Bill can be complete in
Ireland, that time can never be wanted to withstand
the most expeditious. A Bill must come from the
Irish Privy Council to their House of Commons,
must return to the Council, must then be transmitted
to England and back again before it becomes
a law.</p>

<p>But mobs do not reason, nor, if once prepossessed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
listen to reason. A dangerous riot ensued; the
people rose in all parts of Dublin, and possessing
themselves of the avenues of the Parliament, seized
on the members, and obliged them to take an oath
to be true to their country, and to vote against an
union. Many were worse treated. One Rowley, a
rich Presbyterian, who had long opposed the Administration,
they seized and stripped, and were going
to drown, from which they were with difficulty
prevented. Lord Inchiquin, who was newly
arrived from the country on purpose to oppose the
rumoured union, was alike insulted. They pulled
off his periwig and Red Riband, and put the oath
to him. He had an impediment in his speech, and
stuttering, they cried, “Damn you, do you hesitate?”
but hearing that his name was O’Brien, their
rage was turned into acclamations. They pulled
the Bishop of Killala out of his coach, as they did
the Lord Chancellor Bowes, obliging him to take
their oath; but being seized with a droll scruple
that their administering the oath did not give it
legality, they stopped the Chief Justice, and made
the Chancellor renew the oath before him. Malone
was so little in their favour, that though he had
taken the oath, one of the ringleaders dipped his
fist in the kennel before he would shake hands with
him.</p>

<p>They then went to the House of Lords, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Sir Thomas Pendergrass looking out, they pulled
him forth by the nose, and rolled him in the kennel.
In the House they found Lord Farnham taking the
oaths on the death of his father, instead of which
they made him take theirs. There they committed
the grossest and most filthy indecencies, placed an
old woman on the Throne, and sent for pipes and
tobacco for her. They next went to the House of
Commons, and ordered the clerk to bring them the
journals to burn. He obeyed; but telling them
they would destroy the only records of the glorious
year 1755, they were contented to restore them.
But their greatest fury was intended against Rigby,
whom the Duke of Bedford had lately made their
Master of the Rolls. The office there is no post of
business: still the choice of a man so little grave
was not decent. The mob prepared a gallows, and
were determined to hang Rigby on it; but, fortunately,
that morning he had gone out of town to
ride, and received timely notice not to return. The
Duke of Bedford sent to the Mayor to quell the
tumult, but he excused himself on pretence of there
being no Riot Act in Ireland. The Privy Council
was then called together, who advised sending for a
troop of horse. That was executed: the troopers
were ordered not to fire; but riding among the
mob with their swords drawn, slashing and cutting,
they at length dispersed the rioters, after putting to
death fifteen or sixteen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>The Duke of Bedford and Rigby, in their letters
to England, carefully concealed the enormity of the
outrage. They knew Lord Temple wished to be
Lord Lieutenant; and perhaps suspected, that that
ambition had been the foundation of Mr. Pitt’s expostulations.
Those seeds of jealousy, combining
with Rigby’s devotion to Fox, gave rise to the succeeding
animosities between the Duke and Pitt.
What was more remarkable was, that the letters
from the Castle acquitted the Papists of being
authors of the sedition; yet, a short time before,
the Duke had quarrelled with the Primate for saying
he had no apprehensions from that quarter.
Whatever was pretended, there was much reason
for believing that the insurrection had deeper foundation
than in a mere jealousy of an union with
England. Seditious papers had been printed: two
drummers, in the livery of the College, had commenced
the uproar in the Earl of Meath’s Liberties,
telling the people, that if they did not rise by one
o’clock, an Act would be passed to abolish Parliaments
in Ireland. So small, too, was the dislike to
the then Government, that one of the rioters skimming
away Lord Tavistock’s<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> hat, his comrades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
gave him 200 lashes, saying, Lord Tavistock had
not offended them.</p>

<p>But the strongest presumption of the tumult
being excited by the emissaries of France came out
afterwards; it appearing that the commotion began
the very day after intelligence was received that
the French fleet was sailed from Brest. Indeed it is
now past doubt, that the Court of France had laid
a very extensive plan, meditating an attack on the
three kingdoms at one and the same time. England
was to be invaded from Dunkirk, Ireland by the
Brest Fleet, while Thurot<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> was to fall on the north
of Scotland. Nor was Dublin the sole theatre
where confusion was to be spread. Riots were
raised at Cork on the prohibition of exporting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Irish cattle. Mr. Pitt wrote a warm letter to the
Duke of Bedford to complain of his supineness
after such repeated intelligence of the designs of
France.</p>

<p>That storm weathered, the Castle met with little
opposition. Perry, the most formidable of the
minority, they bought off. One man alone gave
them trouble; his name Hutchinson,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> a lawyer.
His views he owned himself. Being asked, on
leaving England, whether he should addict himself
to the Opposition or to the Castle, he replied,
“Not to the Castle, certainly; nothing is to be
gotten there”&mdash;meaning that Rigby engrossed everything.
Hutchinson had good parts, and exerted
them briskly, annoying Rigby, Malone, and the
Courtiers. He said, Lord George Sackville had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
parts, but no integrity; Conway, integrity, but no
parts; now, they were governed by one who had
neither. There was more wit than truth in this
description. Conway’s parts, though not brilliant,
were solid: for Rigby, though he never shone in
the Irish Parliament, no man wanted parts less&mdash;and
his joviality soon made him not only captivate
so bacchanalian a capital, but impress a very
durable memory of his festive sociability.</p>

<p>For the Irish Courtiers, it required no masterly
pencil to expose their profligacy. That was the
case of Sir Richard Cox. Hutchinson moved a
resolution that the vote against pensions had had
effect. “It is true,” said Sir Richard; “I lost a
small pension, and have got a good place&mdash;yet I
should not have expected such a Motion from that
gentleman.” “Oh!” replied Hutchinson, “I
should have opposed the Motion in the House,
though I have now made it in the Committee; I
only had a mind to try if this Committee would
not vote for anything&mdash;yet I cannot believe that
gentleman (Sir Richard Cox) is so very profligate
and abandoned as he says himself.”</p>

to Parliament with Lord Shelburne, the Secretary of State,
in his carriage, communicated to him some intelligence which
it was important should be known to the Ministry, and
equally important should be concealed from the public. Soon
afterwards the coach stopped at the House of Lords, and
Lord Shelburne carelessly asked Lord Chatham if he meant
to speak that day?&mdash;“Not after what I have told you,” was
his Lordship’s answer. His companion then observed, that
he did not see why that should prevent him, as the matter
communicated bore no sort of relation to the question coming

Vie Privée de Louis XV.</cite> says, that Thurot had orders not to
commit hostilities on Scotland, but to invite the Jacobites to
join him.&mdash;Vol. iii. That author has collected a great deal of
curious matter, as far as he could be assisted by public materials;
but his secret history is far from being equally authentic,
nor does he seem to have been conversant with persons well
informed, and near the scene of action. He thinks the first
cause of the Dauphin’s illness and death proceeded from his
vexation at the expulsion of the Jesuits. The Dauphin had
been bred a bigot; but, before his death, was grown a free-thinker
to a very great latitude, and gave very indubitable
marks of it in the last days of his life. The author was as
ignorant of the motives of the Duc de Choiseul’s opposition
to Madame du Barri, and his consequential fall, which the
author imputes to the Duchesse de Grammont, his sister,
being provoked at not being the King’s mistress herself&mdash;a
vulgar story. The author seems to be most versed in the
marine, and the great object of his work, to show that all the
successes of the English, in 1759 and 1760, were owing to
the incapacity of all the Ministers and Commanders, and
especially to the cowardice of their Admirals, to the King’s
indolence, and to Madame de Pompadour’s ascendant.</p></div>

<p>The year began, as the last had concluded, with
severe weather and hard frost; yet the Armies in
Germany kept the field. Glory was not the object
of that war. Mutual animosity excluded all confidence,
and neither side would retire a foot, while
both were impatient to bring things to a conclusion,
and while the Empress Queen, especially, flattered
herself with hopes of crushing her enemy. What
the country suffered from that bitterness is not to
be expressed&mdash;but when are the number considered?
None suffered more than the Saxons. While their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
King and his criminal favourite were wearing out
their inglorious lives in Poland, without power or
esteem, Dresden endured the worst consequences of
Bruhl’s impertinent ambition. Bread was risen
there to elevenpence a pound.</p>

<p>Our Army suffered no less hardships: one day in
December they were fourteen hours under arms, expecting
to be attacked by the French, which was
threatened by Broglio, whose natural vivacity was
encouraged by Prince Ferdinand weakening our
Army. Without waiting for permission from England,
he had detached 12,000 men, under the Hereditary
Prince, to the assistance of the King of
Prussia; a step that highly and justly offended
King George; and the more provoking, as there
was reason to believe the measure concerted with
the King of Prussia to involve both Hanoverians
and English in actual war with the Empress
Queen; a declaration which the British Monarch,
both as King and Elector, had hitherto carefully
avoided. The first question Frederic put to the
Prince of Brunswick was, “What English have you
brought to me?” There were both Highlanders
and Hanoverians. Broglio did, indeed, make an
attack on Prince Ferdinand, who retreated, but repulsed
the French to their loss.</p>

<p>In England the winter was not memorable for
any parliamentary debates; the few of consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
shall be mentioned. Other events, too, I shall not
omit. These sheets, I have often declared, were
less intended for a history of war than for civil
annals. Whatever, therefore, leads to a knowledge
of the characters of remarkable persons, of the
manners of the age, and of its political intrigues,
comes properly within my plan. I am more attentive
to deserve the thanks of posterity than their
admiration. A great modern author (Voltaire)
recommends the omission of small circumstances,
and would confine history to its capital outlines.
In the first place, mine is not history, but Memoirs.
Next, what would be less amusing than such a history?
Battles, revolutions, and the wild waste of war,
are common to all times; but they are the circumstances
that distinguish one age from another.
Lastly, future historians may reject the rubbish,
and preserve only striking events: yet, for the power
of such choice, he must be indebted to us contemporaries.
With me, I own, one reflection further has
determined me to the course I have pursued. They
are the minutiæ of which I have observed Posterity is
ever most fond; they are the omissions that historians
in their grandeur disdain to record, which
the humble reader most painfully labours to recover,
and, if recovered, to weave into the materials
of which he is already possessed. The patchwork
seldom unites well, for want of those lights which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
contemporaries might have given. Is it not more
eligible to have chaff to winnow, than to add to a
stack?</p>

<p>Lord Bath,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> assisted by Douglas,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> his Chaplain,
published a piece called “A Letter to Two Great
Men,” (Mr. Pitt and the Duke of Newcastle.) It
contained a plan of the terms which his Lordship
thought we ought to demand, if we concluded a
peace. It was as little regarded by the persons it
addressed as a work of Mr. Pitt’s would have been,
if, outliving his patriotism, power, and character,
he should twenty years after have emerged in a
pamphlet. However, it pleased in coffee-houses
more than it deserved, yet made much less noise than
a farce written at the same time by an Irish player,
one Macklyn,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> called <cite>Love à la Mode</cite>. The principal
characters were a Scotchman and an Irishman;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>the first, heightened and odious; the latter, softened
and amiable, played inimitably by one Moody.
What made it memorable was, that Lord Bute<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> interposed
to have it prohibited. This intervention
made the ridicule on the Scotch the more tasted;
and being tasted, it would have been too offensive to
the public to have stopped the run. A composition
was made that it should not be printed. The King,
whose age then kept him from public places, sent
for the copy, and ordered it to be read to him.</p>

<p>Lord George Sackville, having waited till the
officers returned from Germany, had written at the
end of the year to Lord Holderness, demanding a
Court-Martial. He received for answer, that it
would be referred to the Judges; a question having
arisen, whether he could legally be tried, the orders
he had disobeyed having been given by a foreigner.
The Attorney and Solicitor Generals, however, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
the Judges, were the persons consulted, and they
gave their opinions that he might have a Court-Martial.
Another doubt had been started, whether,
having been dismissed from the service, his Lordship
could yet be subject to military law; but this was
then passed over; and, Jan. 18th, Lord Holderness
notified the opinion of the Attorney and Solicitor
to Lord George, adding, that his Majesty desired to
know how his Lordship wished to have the proceeding,
<em>as there was no specific charge against
him</em>. This disculpation under the hand of a Secretary
of State was remarkable. Some surmised that
it had been contrived by Lord Mansfield, a friend
to Lord George. It was palpable, at least, that
the Court had gone even this length, in order to
hold out to Lord George an opportunity of not pushing
the matter any further.</p>

<p>He, notwithstanding, assuming to himself such a
conviction of innocence, that he declared he would
even accept of Lord Tyrawley<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> (a brutal man, and
one of his bitterest foes on that and former occasions)
for president of the Court-Martial, wrote in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
reply to Lord Holderness, “that he had no business
to accuse himself, nor had been guilty of any fault;
but that he concluded Prince Ferdinand must have
exhibited some charge against him; otherwise, undoubtedly
his Majesty would not have stripped him
of everything in so ignominious a manner. He
therefore repeated his petition for a Court-Martial,
and would abide the event.” Intimations at the
same time were privately given to Lord George,
that if he would desist from prosecuting the affair,
the Court would also. On the other hand, he was
told, that be the consequence how severe soever, the
King was firm to let the law take its course, should
the Court-Martial once proceed.</p>

<p>With any mitigation of his fate, if the event was
sinister, Lord George could not flatter himself. He
had too many and too powerful enemies, to expect
any remission. The King hated him, and hated
those who favoured him, the Prince’s faction. The
Duke was as ill-inclined to him. Fox, from private
resentments, was his enemy. The Army, whether
the officers were attached to the Duke, to Prince
Ferdinand, or to Lord Granby, were equally averse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
to him. Mr. Pitt, though <em>no bitter enemy</em>, had
adopted Prince Ferdinand’s cause. The people, too,
who in a free country are reckoned for something,
were prepossessed against him. In his own profession
he had disgusted many, both of superior and
inferior rank. Newcastle, who never felt for a
powerless friend, had abandoned him. The house
of Bedford, from reasons of family,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> were not his
well-wishers.</p>

<p>What had he to depend on?&mdash;an ancient father
and mother, of great dignity indeed, and old servants
of the Crown;<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> but the Duke retired, disgraced
almost, and worn out by age and infirmities; their
small circle of friends; the Scotch obnoxious at
Court by the mutual hatred between the Duke of
Cumberland and them since the last Rebellion, and
from being attached to the Prince, and even by
being attached to Lord George; his own parts; and
perhaps the unwillingness of every profession to
proceed against a member of their own corps&mdash;what
frail trust, when weighed against influence!&mdash;yet
he pushed on his trial, and sought danger, though
he saw it, and must have weighed it. If here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>ambition preponderated over fear, at least he was
not always a coward. It was pretended that Lord
Mansfield had assured him he could not be convicted&mdash;but
do General Officers weigh legal niceties in the
scales of Westminster Hall? Does their education
qualify them for the tenderness required of English
juries? Are not military men apt to pique themselves
on showing antipathy to every suspicion of
cowardice, unless they are very brave and sensible
indeed?</p>

<p>For my own part, I would sooner pronounce Lord
George a hero for provoking his trial, than a
coward for shrinking from the French. He would
have been in less danger by leading up the Cavalry
at Minden, than in every hour that he went down to
the Horse-guards as a criminal. But whatever apology
is due to Lord George’s spirit, none offers itself for
his judgment. The obvious consequence of a trial
was condemnation. Laying aside the consideration
of life, ambition, and restlessness under the ruin of
his fortune, which probably dictated his insisting on
a Court-Martial, were almost certain of being disappointed
by a formal sentence.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> A legal conviction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of cowardice would for ever dash his hopes. An
acquittal would but partially remove such an imputation.
The Court’s avowal of there being no
specific charge against him was equal in value to
<em>such</em> an acquittal. Time would have drawn a kind
of oblivion over what was passed: art and future
incidents might have superinduced a plea in his
favour from the supposed animosity of Prince Ferdinand.
A declaration of the Court rather in his
favour was of more weight than even an acquittal
after the reproach of an actual trial. As a Military
man he could entertain no further views. In a
civil light he might thereafter construe the rigour
he had felt into substantial merit. The approaching
reign promised to be favourable to any sufferer
under the present; nor could Lord George but know,
that to be the enemy of Prince Ferdinand would be
meritorious in the eyes of the Prince and Princess
Dowager, who hated the Ducal line of Brunswick.</p>

<p>But this was not the only error Lord George
Sackville had made in judgment. It is not easy to
conceive why he had persisted to seek employment
in Germany, if he felt <em>that</em> within him which told
him the road of martial glory was not his proper
walk. He had interest enough to waive service;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
and had his declining it been interpreted to his disadvantage,
what was suspicion in comparison of
proof? On the 23rd of January he was acquainted
that he should have a Court-Martial. It was appointed,
and General Onslow<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> constituted President.
A messenger was dispatched to Prince Ferdinand to
send over evidence. To General Balfour, nominated
one of his Judges, Lord George objected, on
the score of former enmity between them.</p>

<p>While this affair was depending, a more atrocious
criminal appeared on the stage. Lawrence, Earl
Ferrers, had been parted from his wife,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and an
allowance settled on her by Parliament out of his
estate, for his causeless ill-usage of her. A receiver
of his rents, too, had been appointed, but the nomination
left to the Earl, who named one Johnson, his
own steward. That honest man not proving so
tractable as his Lordship expected, had fallen under
his displeasure. The Earl lived at his own seat in
Leicestershire with a former mistress, whom he had
taken again on being separated from his wife, and
by whom he had four children. In that retirement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>there appeared many symptoms of a frenzy incident
to his family, as had also during his cohabitation
with his lady; and frequent drunkenness inflamed
the disorder. In that mood of madness and
revenge he sent for Johnson, having artfully dispatched
his family and servants different ways on
various pretences. The poor man was no sooner
alone with him, than the Earl locking the door,
and holding a pistol to his breast, would have
obliged Johnson to sign a paper, avowing himself a
villain. While the unhappy man, kneeling at his
feet, hesitated to sign, Lord Ferrers shot him in the
body. The wound was mortal, but not instantly
so. Remorse or fear seized on the murderer, for he
was then sober. He sent for a surgeon, and wished
to have Johnson saved. Those sentiments soon
vanished, or were expelled by drink; for the Earl
passed the remaining hours of that horrid day between
his bottle and the chamber of the expiring
man, sometimes in promises to his daughter, whom
he had summoned to her father, oftener in transports
of insult, threats, and cruelty, to the victim
himself, who languished till the next morning. At
first the Peer prepared to defend himself from being
seized; but his courage failed him, as it had on
former occasions. He was apprehended by the
populace, and lodged in Leicester jail. Thence he
was brought to town, and carried before the House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
of Lords, where his behaviour was cool and sensible.
The Lords committed him to the Tower.</p>

<p>In February was tried a criminal of a still different
complexion. Dr. Smollett was convicted in
the King’s Bench of publishing scurrilous abuse on
Admiral Knollys in the Critical Review. Smollett
was a worthless man, and only mentioned here because
author of a History of England, of the errors
in which posterity ought to be warned. Smollett
was bred a sea-surgeon, and turned author. He
wrote a tragedy, and sent it to Lord Lyttelton,
with whom he was not acquainted. Lord Lyttelton,
not caring to point out its defects, civilly advised
him to try comedy. He wrote one, and solicited
the same Lord to recommend it to the stage. The
latter excused himself, but promised, if it should be
acted, to do all the service in his power for the
author. Smollett’s return was drawing an abusive
portrait of Lord Lyttelton in Roderick Random, a
novel; of which sort he published two or three. His
next attempt was on the History of England; a
work in which he engaged for booksellers, and
finished, though four volumes in quarto, in two
years; yet an easy task, as being pilfered from
other histories. Accordingly, it was little noticed
till it came down to the present time: then, though
compiled from the libels of the age and the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
paltry materials, yet being heightened by personal
invectives, strong Jacobitism, and the worst representation
of the Duke of Cumberland’s conduct in
Scotland, the sale was prodigious. Eleven thousand
copies of that trash were instantly sold, while at
the same time the university of Oxford ventured
to print but two thousand of that inimitable work,
Lord Clarendon’s Life! A reflection on the age
sad to mention, yet too true to be suppressed!
Smollett’s work was again printed, and again tasted:
it was adorned with wretched prints, except two
or three by Strange,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> who could not refuse his admirable
graver to the service of the Jacobite cause.</p>

<p>Smollett then engaged in a monthly magazine,
called the Critical Review, the scope of which was
to decry any work that appeared favourable to the
principles of the Revolution. Nor was he single in
that measure. The Scotch in the heart of London
assumed a dictatorial power of reviling every book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
that censured the Stuarts, or upheld the Revolution&mdash;a
provocation they ought to have remembered
when the tide rolled back upon them. Smollett,
while in prison,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> undertook a new magazine; and
notwithstanding the notoriety of his disaffection,
obtained the King’s patent for it by the interest of
Mr. Pitt, to whom he had dedicated his history. In
the following reign he was hired to write a scurrilous
paper, called the Briton, against that very
patron, Mr. Pitt.</p>

<p>While the trials of Lord George Sackville and
Earl Ferrers were preparing, the attention of the
public was drawn off to Ireland. We have mentioned
the escape of Thurot from Dunkirk, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
arrival with his pigmy squadron in Sweden. His
expedition was a codicil to the lofty plan of invading
these kingdoms in various parts at once. While
the expedition from the coast of France should pour
its flat-bottomed boats on this island, Conflans was
to fall on Ireland, and Thurot to make a diversion
either in Scotland or in the North of Ireland. His
armament, originally composed but of five frigates,
was by various accidents reduced to three: his
twelve hundred men, by sickness, to half that
number. The winter too was so adverse, that they
lost three months in beating about among the
northern isles; whence their provisions were so consumed,
that they were obliged in the middle of
February to put into the Isle of Islay to recruit.
Supplied they were, and paid for what they received.
Scotland was too wise to take a step further
in behalf of so forlorn a hope.</p>

<p>There he learned the fate of the larger machine,
the defeat of Conflans. Ambitious, however, of
personal honour, and aware that desperate characters
can only be supported by desperate actions,
he determined to make an attempt on some part of
Ireland; and about the 28th of February appeared
before Carrickfergus. The remonstrances of the
English Ministry had operated so little on the Administration
in Ireland, that Carrickfergus, though
seated in the heart of the Protestant interest, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
arms might securely have been trusted, was found
by Thurot totally unguarded and unprovided.
Making a draught from his seamen, he landed with
a small body, and prepared to attack the town
which was so little prepared to resist. The walls
were ruinous, in many places incomplete. The
force within consisted of four companies&mdash;unluckily,
<em>they</em> consisted but of seventy-two men. They were
commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Jennings, a man
formed for a hero; for he had great bravery and a
small portion of sense. Thurot, who wanted provisions
even more than glory, was content to make
a demand of about twenty articles, for which he
promised to pay. In case of refusal he threatened
to burn the place, and then to march to Belfast, a
far more opulent and commercial town. Colonel
Jennings, who had scarce any ammunition, thought
it more prudent to comply than to resist, when he
had no means of resisting. He agreed to furnish
Thurot with what he wanted. Some disagreement,
however, arising, the capitulation was broken.
The gates were shut against the invaders&mdash;still to
the honour of Jennings, for the gates had neither
bars nor locks. The fight began by firing at each
other through the gates: but the Irish ammunition
soon failing, so brave was the garrison, and so
zealous the inhabitants, that for some time they defended
themselves with brick-bats, which the rotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
condition of the walls easily supplied. When even
those stores were exhausted, Jennings retired to the
castle, while four or five raw recruits still defended
the shattered gates. The citadel, however, could
not hold out without either powder or provisions.
It surrendered, and the garrison were made prisoners.
Thurot plundered the town, and then sent to demand
contributions from Belfast.</p>

<p>Ridiculous as this campaign was, it was no joke
to the Duke of Bedford. Jennings and his puny
force had shown themselves willing to do their
utmost. The success of Thurot was a glaring comment
on the negligence of his Grace’s administration.
The danger to which so wealthy a town as
Belfast was exposed was still more alarming. General
Fitzwilliam was immediately detached with
four regiments of Foot and three of Horse to drive
out the invaders. The Lord Lieutenant in person
promised to overtake him at Newry. But Thurot
would not give his Grace an opportunity of retrieving
his own carelessness. Taking along with him
the Mayor and three of the principal inhabitants of
Carrickfergus, Thurot again put to sea.</p>

<p>Another measure taken by the Irish Administration
had luckier consequences. They had sent advice
of the invasion to Kingsale, where lay three of
our best frigates. Elliot<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> commanded them. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
instantly sailed, and came up with Thurot in the
Irish Channel. Elliot’s vessels were inferior in size
and number to Thurot’s, but cleaner, and the men
fresh. After a smart action, he boarded Thurot’s
ship. The latter fell, but not till he had given
proof of the most romantic bravery. The other
two frigates soon struck, and were all carried into
the Isle of Man. Elliot’s account to the Admiralty
was penned with such modesty, that a more important
victory had not been more honourable.</p>

<p>Feb. 28th, Lord Barrington acquainted the House
of Commons that Lord George Sackville had been
put under arrest for disobedience of orders. The
Speaker had been much averse to the trial of a
member who was no longer in the Army, and hoped
it would be opposed: but it was not. Lord Milton,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
brother-in-law of Lord George, was empowered by
him to say that the trial was what he earnestly desired.
Lord Barrington then moved an Address
of Thanks to the King for the communication, and
for his Majesty’s tenderness of the privileges of the
House. This being readily agreed to, Lord Barrington
said it was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nemine contradicente</i>; but
Doddington<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> had faintly said no, and the Speaker
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>said there had been a negative. Sir Francis Dashwood
then said, that he had not opposed the Address,
as Lord George wished the trial; but he
hoped the measure would be considered hereafter in
some Mutiny Bill, and that the time might be
limited how long persons who had quitted the Army
should be liable to martial law. Doddington added,
“that everybody seemed to agree it ought not to
remain law; that he did not think it law; nay,
that Lord George might have been tried while he
was a military man. Martial law was growing
upon us, would eat up the banks, and overflow the
whole. The Mutiny Bill fell to the ground every
year, but, like the giant, recovered new strength on
touching it.” Sir John Rushout added, that, were
he in the Army, he would not sit on the trial of any
man out of it. Sir Francis Dashwood promised to
call for a revisal of the Mutiny Bill, if nobody else
did.</p>

<p>The next day the Court-Martial met. When
Lord George Sackville appeared before it, seeing
General Balfour on the bench, he said, he thought
that officer had not been to sit on him, he having
made his exceptions, and been told Balfour should
not be of the Court. Balfour said, he came not to
be a judge, nor desired to be, but to know the exception,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
which he thought touched his honour&mdash;a
strong proof how dissonant Courts-Martial are from
the spirit of the English constitution, which does
not understand that persons accused are to be awed
by points of romantic honour from excepting
against their jury, if suspected of enmity or partiality.
Lord George pleaded opposition that Balfour
had exercised against him in the Ordnance.
The Court-Martial voted that reason insufficient,
but told Balfour they would excuse his attendance
if he desired it; which he did. They had no such
power either of voting the exception invalid, or of
excusing him. The King had appointed him, and
had allowed the exception. The next step was
more respectful to the laws, and came from a
quarter which was not suspected of much tenderness
to the prisoner. Lord Albemarle<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> asked him
if he was in the Army; the judge-advocate for the
prisoner answered, “No.” The Court then was
cleared, and adjourned to the following Thursday
(it was then Friday), desiring to have the opinion
of the Judges, <em>whether a man no longer in the
Army was subject to martial law</em>. The Attorney
and Solicitor Generals had determined in the
affirmative, grounding their sentiment on those
words of the Mutiny Bill, “<em>All persons being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
officers on the 25th of March, and committing
such and such faults within the course of the
year</em>,” &amp;c. These words being in force as long as
the Bill, they thought comprehended such persons
for the same period.</p>

<p>Lord Albemarle had gone further: he had asked
if the Court was empowered to inflict any punishment
under capital on the delinquent. This provision
of tenderness was not expected from the favourite
of the Duke of Cumberland, or from one who
had expressed himself warmly enough against Lord
George. Private reasons were sought for this conduct
by those who would not suppose that in <em>that</em>
trial any motives but those of passion or interest
would be hearkened to. They who canvassed Lord
Albemarle’s behaviour under such prejudice accounted
for it by the Duke’s envy of Prince Ferdinand,
and desire of rescuing even that hated
criminal from his vengeance&mdash;yet were those but
surmises, not corroborated by any appearance of
acrimony in the complexion or conduct of the
judges. So ill, however, was Lord Albemarle’s
obstruction of the proceedings accepted by the
King, who now pushed on the trial angrily and
indecently, that his mother, Lady Albemarle,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
omitted in the private nightly parties at Court, and
not spoken to in the morning Drawing-Room.</p>

<p>The King went further: Prince Ferdinand was
impatient for the return of the officers: General
Onslow, President of the Court-Martial, was member
of another on Lord Charles Hay,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> a brave but mad
officer, who having in America reflected on the
dilatoriness of Lord Loudon, had been put under
arrest by him. Onslow at that trial was seized
with <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'an apopletic fit'">an apoplectic fit</ins>, and died. The King was so impatient
of any delay on Lord George Sackville’s case,
that the Duke of Newcastle, at four in the afternoon,
was ordered to send to the Secretary at War, then
in the House of Commons, directions to have a new
commission made out that very evening, that not a
day might be lost. Four more members too were
added to the Court, to guard against any deficiency,
the law allowing not a greater number than twenty-one,
nor less than thirteen.</p>

<p>Ten Judges (the other two, Bathurst<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> and Clive,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>of which the former held Lord George’s trial illegal,
being absent on the Circuit,) gave their opinions,
that, as far as they could then see, he might be
tried; but they reserved to themselves a further
consideration, if any appeal should be made from
the sentence. On the very day on which they
were to deliver their opinion arrived the account
of Thurot’s defeat and death. There was a great
Court to congratulate the King; yet so impatient
was he to learn the decision of the Bench, that he
scarce stayed a moment in the Drawing-Room. In
private he expressed, without decency, his apprehensions
of what the German Princes would think
of his want of power, should he not be able to obtain
Lord George’s trial and condemnation. The moment
he was certified that the trial might proceed,
he named General Pulteney<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> President of the court
in the room of Onslow; and Pulteney excusing
himself, Sir Charles Howard<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> was appointed.</p>

<p>March 7th, the trial recommenced. Lord
George, who treated his adversaries with little
management, desired the Judge-Advocate to explain
to Wintzenrode, Prince Ferdinand’s Aide-de-camp,
the nature of perjury: the German replied handsomely,
that he understood it both from religion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>and honour, and supposed it was the same in all
countries.</p>

<p>Through the course of the trial, which being in
print it is not necessary to recapitulate, the chief
examinents were General Cholmondeley<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and Lord
Albemarle; both appearing unfavourable to Lord
George, and the latter as little sparing Prince
Ferdinand, when, by any indirect question, he
could draw forth evidence of the Prince having
been surprised into the battle. The rest of
the Court took so little share in the examination,
that Cholmondeley complained of the invidious part
that was forced on him. Sloper was particularly
acrimonious in his evidence against Lord George,
and was believed actuated by General Mordaunt, so
warmly did the latter resent Lord George’s practices
on the miscarriage at Rochfort; though, if
Lord George stirred up the prosecution of that
affair, Mordaunt had only suffered by implication:
Conway was Lord George’s object; but Conway
was far from retorting that injury in the same
manner.</p>

<p>Lord Granby, who was actually involved in the
trial as evidence, showed the same honourable and
compassionate tenderness. So far from exaggerating
the minutest circumstance, he palliated or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
suppressed whatever might load the prisoner, and
seemed to study nothing but how to avoid appearing
a party against him&mdash;so inseparable in his
bosom were valour and good-nature. That the
constitution of the Court itself was not unfavourable
to Lord George, appeared, when a question
that bore hard against him being put by General
Cholmondeley, and Lord Robert Bertie objecting to
it, it was put to the vote, and by the majority not
admitted to be asked.</p>

<p>Lord George’s own behaviour was most extraordinary.
He had undoubtedly trusted to the
superiority of his parts for extricating him. Most
men in his situation would have adapted such parts
to the conciliating the favour of his judges, to
drawing the witnesses into contradictions, to misleading
and bewildering the Court, and to throwing
the most specious colours on his own conduct,
without offending the parties declared against him.
Very different was the conduct of Lord George.
From the outset, and during the whole process, he
assumed a dictatorial style to the Court, and treated
the inferiority of their capacities as he would have
done if sitting amongst them. He browbeat the
witnesses, gave the lie to Sloper, and used the
Judge Advocate, though a very clever man, with
contempt. Nothing was timid&mdash;nothing humble in
his behaviour. His replies were quick and spirited.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
He prescribed to the Court, and they acquiesced.
An instant of such resolution at Minden had established
his character for ever.</p>

<p>The trial had lasted longer than was expected.
The Mutiny Bill expired. A new warrant was
forced to be made out, and the depositions were
read over to the witnesses. It was the third of
April before the whole proceeding was closed: the
event different from what Lord George had presumed,
and yet short of what he had reason to
expect. The Court-Martial pronounced him guilty
of having disobeyed Prince Ferdinand’s orders,
whom by his commission and instructions he was
ordered to obey, and declared it their opinion that
he was unfit to serve his Majesty in any military
capacity whatever.</p>

<p>The King confirmed the sentence, but, dissatisfied
that it had gone no further, he could not resist the
ungenerous impulse of loading it with every insult
in his power; impotent, as circumscribed in narrower
limits than his wishes; and unjust, as exceeding
the bounds of a just trial; since no man ought
to be punished beyond his sentence. The Court-Martial’s
decision was directed to be given out in
public orders to the Army, declaring the sentence
worse than death. The King struck Lord George’s
name out of the Council Book, and forbad his appearance
at Court. The Lord Chamberlain, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
was ordered to notify that prohibition to the Prince
of Wales and the Princess-Dowager; and lest that
should not be sufficient, the Vice Chamberlain was
sent to acquaint Lord Bute with it, who said, to be
sure the Prince would not think of seeing Lord
George while it was disagreeable to his Majesty.
Lord George’s witnesses and friends were treated
with no less cruelty. Hugo, a Hanoverian, was
dismissed on his return to the Army. John Smith
was obliged to quit it here; and Cunningham was
sent to America, though he had been there three
times already. Yet not a murmur followed: as the
object was obnoxious, even the dangerous precedent
of persecuting witnesses who had thwarted the
inclinations of the Court made no impression&mdash;so
much do liberty and power depend on circumstances
and seasons.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>The trial of Lord Ferrers had more solemn conclusion.
To one man his crimes were advantageous.
Sir Robert Henley, Lord Keeper, had been hoisted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>to that eminence by circumstances of faction; which,
however, could not give weight to his decisions in
Chancery. Those, as he complained, were often
reversed before his face by the House of Lords
without his being empowered to defend them, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
not being a Peer. It was proper to appoint him
Lord High Steward for the trial of Lord Ferrers;
and it was requisite, to fill that office, that he should
be a Peer. Henley was accordingly created a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Baron; but as the Seals had not taught him more
law, a Coronet and White Staff contributed as little
to give him more dignity. He despised form, even
where he had little to do but to be formal. He did
not want sense, and spirit still less; but he could
not, or would not, stoop to so easy a lesson as that
of ceremonial.</p>

<p>Nothing is more awful than the trial of a British
Peer; yet, the mean appearance of the prisoner,
and the vulgar awkwardness of the Chief Judge,
made the present trial as little imposing as possible.
The Earl’s behaviour conciliated no favour to him:
it was somewhat sullen, and his defence contemptible,
endeavouring to protract the time, though without
address. At length he pleaded madness&mdash;unwillingly,
but in compliance with the entreaties of his
family. The audience was touched at the appearance
of his two brothers, reduced to depose to the
lunacy in their blood. But those impressions were
effaced, and gave way to horror, when it appeared
to the Court that the Earl had gloried in his shocking
deed. Being easily convicted, he begged pardon
of his Judges for having used the plea of madness.
But if his life was odious, and during his life his
cowardice notorious, he showed at his death that
he did not want sense, resolution, or temper. He
bore the ignominy of his fate like a philosopher, and
went to meet it with the ease of a gentleman. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the tedious passage of his conveyance from the Tower
to Tyburn, which was impeded by the crowds that
assembled round his coach, he dropped not a rash
word, nor one that had not sense and thought in it.
Little was wanting to grace his catastrophe but less
resentment to his wife, the peculiarity of being
executed in his wedding habit too strongly marking
that he imputed his calamity to that source. His
relation, Lady Huntingdon, the Metropolitan of the
Methodists, had laboured much in his last hours to
profit of his fears for the honour of her sect; but,
having renounced the plea of madness, he did not
choose to resign his intellects to folly. So impudent,
however, were those knavish zealots, that one Loyd,
a Methodist, having been robbed by his coachman,
a Methodist too, Whitfield appeared at the trial
before the Lord Mayor, and read an excommunication
that he had pronounced against the coachman.
They would have accepted a murderer, if a proselyte
from the Established Church; and flattered themselves
that they could shake off the infamy of a
house-breaker by casting him out from their own&mdash;so
brief and effectual do enthusiasts hold their own
legerdemain.</p>

<p>A man, whose pretensions to virtue were as equivocal
as Whitfield’s to sanctity, took upon him
about this time to lay straiter obligations on members
of Parliament. The plan, like that of hypocrites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
of all denominations, was, by coining new
occasions of guilt. Sir John Philipps brought a
Bill into the House of Commons to oblige the members
to give in particulars of their qualifications,
<em>and to swear to the truth of them</em>. A known
Jacobite, who and whose friends had taken the
oaths to King George, ought to have been sensible
that perjury was <em>not</em> the crime at which most men
stuck in that age: nor could it be hoped that they
who made a seat in Parliament the foundation of
their fortune would not overleap any obstacle to
obtain one. Pitt, James Grenville, and Beckford
promoted the Bill. Lord Egmont opposed it with
great ability, and pointed out how much it would
subject all estates to the inspection, and, consequently,
to the iniquitous practices of attorneys:
and he showed that western estates in particular
were so circumstanced, that, without double the
qualification required, they would not be sufficient
to answer it. Much spirit against the Bill appeared
in others. The Duke of Newcastle was very
averse to it, but forced to swallow it a little curtailed,
as Pitt insisted that something must be
done to gratify the Tories. Lord Strange ridiculed
it, particularly one notorious blunder: the
Bill directed that no man should take his seat till
he had produced his qualification, and sworn to it in
a full House, the Speaker in the chair. This, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
the opening of a new Parliament, was an impossibility&mdash;by
whom was the Speaker to be chosen?
Young Thomas Townshend spoke warmly against
it, and traced its origin to the four last disgraceful
years of Queen Anne, when a like Bill had been
attempted by the Tories.</p>

<p>The Bill, however, passed both Houses. In the
Lords, the Duke of Richmond and the Earls of
Gower and Hilsborough opposed it. Lord Temple
supported it insolently, threatening disunion if it
were not allowed to pass. Lord Hardwicke seemed
but cool towards it; yet he treated the Commons
arrogantly, and said he had winked at many things
for the sake of union. Lord Gower put it home to
the Bishops, whether the Bill would not multiply
perjuries; yet it was carried by <em>fifty</em> to <em>sixteen</em>, as
it had been in the other House by fourscore to
forty.</p>

<p>A Bill for a Militia in Scotland was less successful;
nor could the disaffected there obtain this mode
of having their arms restored. Pitt had acquiesced;
but the Duke of Newcastle, the Solicitor-General
Yorke, Nugent, Lord Barrington, and the young
Whigs, attacked it with all their force. Even the
Scotch Lord Advocate spoke with spirit against it.
Elliot defended it masterly; and Sir Henry Erskine
went so far as to say that all Scotland would come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
and demand it at the bar of the House. Unluckily
for that menace, the man who had most weight in
that country, the Duke of Argyll, was not cordial
to the Bill, and it was rejected by <em>one hundred
and ninety-four</em> to <em>eighty-four</em>.</p>

<p>A proposed extension of the Militia met with
the same fate. It had been granted for five years.
The counties which had adopted it grew tired of
the expense. The Tory gentlemen were fond of
this more decent mode of accepting emoluments.
To humour them and George Townshend, Pitt had
consented that a Bill should be brought in to make
the expense common to the whole kingdom, by
enabling the counties where Militia was raised to
draw on the Exchequer. The Speaker advertised
the House that this would not only be a Money
Bill, but must have the consent of, nay, must be
recommended by, the Crown. That the King absolutely
refused to give. Notice being taken of the
Bill’s non-appearance, Lord Strange, in his frank
manner, said, “Why did not gentlemen speak out?
was it not that his Majesty would not consent to
the Bill?” Pitt, to draw all possible honour from
what he could not bestow, replied, it was now too
late in the session; but if any man would renew
the Motion the second day of next session, even to
make the Militia perpetual, he would not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
second, but try to get the Bill passed before the
supplies; yet what were those supplies to feed but
his own war, which he <em>boasted</em> had doubled the
expense of any year of Queen Anne? This very
year above sixteen millions were voted.</p>

two-and-twenty years afterwards, it may not be improper to
touch slightly the occasion of its being recalled; together
with a few outlines of the subsequent life of a man, whose
disgrace seemed to have annihilated him for ever in a political
light; and who, though his restless ambition incited him
again to aspire to high employments and honours, both which
he attained, will never figure in history as an admired character,
since he acquired no successes, no glory for his country
by his councils, strengthened[107] rather than effaced the suspicion
of his courage, almost forfeited the general opinion of
his parts, and obtained no honours that were not balanced by
redoubled disgraces and mortifications. He was admitted
into a lucrative, though subordinate, post in Lord Rockingham’s
first Administration; was grossly insulted by Governor
Johnson, whom he challenged and fought<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> with a coolness that
with almost all men justly palliated or removed the imputation
on his spirit. Not long after the commencement of the fatal
American war he was suddenly hoisted to the management
of it; in the course of which he was frequently exposed to
most bitter apostrophes on his former imputed timidity, and
did but give new handle to that imputation by the tameness or
feebleness with which he bore or repelled those attacks; while
the want of vigour in his defences, void of any emanations of
parts, made his abilities as much questioned as his spirit by
those who were too young to remember his former exertions.
Whether his councils and plans were ill-grounded, impolitic,
or unwise, or whether the recovery of America was unattainable
when he entered on the office, it is certain that not only
ill success attended almost every one of the measures he
recommended or promoted, but two disgraces<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> (unparalleled
so far, that <em>two</em> similar never happened to any country in any
one war) <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'befel the British'">befell the British</ins> arms, sufficient to blast, if not
demolish any Minister so unauspiciously seconded by fortune.
Yet misfortune and disgrace were not entirely the
causes of Lord George’s fall. The mercenary intrigue and
treachery of a few of his associates tumbled him in a moment
from a height which he decorated so ill&mdash;while the partiality
or obstinacy of a Sovereign, whose passions he implicitly
obeyed, compensated his fall by the extravagant reward of a
Viscount’s coronet. This exaltation was as abruptly and
cruelly the occasion of recalling the former stigma. The
Marquis of Carmarthen<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> proposed to the House of Lords to
protest against the admission into their order of a man stamped
by an indelible brand, and by a sentence that had never been
cancelled. The positive Monarch precipitated the patent in
defiance. The Marquis, as unshaken, pursued his hostility,
solicited the Peers to condemn the indignity offered to them;
and the new Viscount was reduced in the first debate, after
taking his seat, to hear his former sentence read to his face,
and to combat in person for the Sovereign’s prerogative
right of giving, and his own competence of receiving, the
conferred honour.&mdash;A.</p></div>

<p>Those prodigious efforts were crowned, though
not with universal, yet with most important success.
In Germany, the campaign was far from
decisive; but in America the war was concluded.
After the loss of Quebec, the French retired into
the heart of Canada. General Murray,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> a brave
and adventurous officer, with a garrison of about
seven thousand men, and with the terror our arms
had inspired, was left to defend the ruins of Quebec.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
The frost had obliged the Fleet to retire. Monsieur
Levi, who had succeeded Montcalm, seized that last
opportunity of struggling to recover their empire.
Assembling a body of French, Canadians, and Indians,
to the amount of ten thousand and upwards,
he marched in April to besiege the capital. General
Murray, impatient to be cooped within walls into
which the English had entered so impetuously, disdained
to await a regular siege, and, with far more
intrepidity than policy, marched out with inferior
force, attacked the French, and was defeated. He
lost his cannon, but was sufficiently fortunate in
not being cut off, as he was near being, from his
retreat to the City. Levi soon prepared to form
the siege by land and sea, having brought up six
frigates; against which we had not a single vessel.
The place must have fallen into the hands of its
old masters, if, on the 9th of May, Lord Colville,
with two frigates, outsailing the British squadron,
had not entered the river and demolished the
French armament. Levi, from the heights on the
other side, was witness to that defeat; and, judging
rightly that the rest of our naval force approached,
broke up his camp in haste and confusion, and retreated,
leaving his Artillery behind him.</p>

<p>One resource still remained&mdash;Montreal. There
Monsieur de Vaudreuil, the General Governor, fixed
his stand, and collected the whole force of the province.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
But he had to deal with a man, who, as
brave as Wolfe or as Murray, and as circumspect as
Vaudreuil was insidious, possessed the whole system
of war. Provident, methodic, conciliating, and
cool, Amherst disposed his plans, adapted his measures,
reconciled jarring interests, and pursued his
operations with steadiness; neither precipitating
nor delaying beyond the due point, and comprehending
the whole under an authority which he
knew how to assume, and to temper from giving
disgust.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> A character so composed could not shine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
on a sudden: it required penetration to admire
him; but the finer the details, the more astonishing
was the result.</p>

<p>Amherst had determined, by one collective arrangement,
to overwhelm the last hopes of France
in Canada; an object sufficiently important to justify
the exertion of superabundant resources. Colonel
Haviland was ordered to sail <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'from Crown-point'">from Crown Point</ins>,
and proceed directly to Montreal: General
Murray was commanded to bring up all the force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
he could spare from Quebec. Amherst himself, with
a body of ten thousand men, and reinforced by a
thousand savages under Sir William Johnson, embarked
on Lake Ontario for the river St. Laurence;
a spectacle that recalled the expeditions of ancient
story, when the rudeness and novelty of naval
armaments raised the first adventurers to the rank
of demigods. That vast lake was to be traversed
in open galleys laden with artillery, not with arrows
and javelins. Wolfe, with all the formidable apparatus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
of modern war, had almost failed before
Quebec: Amherst with barks and boats invaded
Montreal, and achieved the conquest, though, what
would have daunted the heroes of antiquity, he had
the cataracts to pass. He surmounted that danger
with inconsiderable loss, and appeared before Montreal
on the very same day with General Murray.
Too many obstacles, to which Monsieur de Vaudreuil
had trusted, were conquered. The place
itself was little tenable. The Governor took the
only part that remained, that of surrendering his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
garrison prisoners of war. Thus was the French
empire in Canada annihilated without effusion of
blood. Amherst’s glory was completed by pardoning
Vaudreuil’s perfidy and cruelties, and by preserving
the vanquished from insult and injury.</p>

<p>The power of France drew as near to a period in
the East Indies. Colonel Coote, Major Brereton,
who fell in the contest, Major Monson, and others,
carried on the war triumphantly. Lally, who left
no valour unexerted, no stratagem unattempted,
was constantly defeated. Sir George Pococke entirely
dispersed their Navy in those seas after three
repeated engagements.</p>

<p>The German war was far from drawing to a conclusion.
It was next to a miracle, considering how
gloomily the last campaign had terminated for the
King of Prussia, that the present did not complete
his ruin. The Empress Queen’s hatred and resources
were by no means exhausted. She contrived,
too, to keep up to the same mark the implacability
of the Czarina, who, having less both to hope and
to fear, may well be believed to have been actuated
by bribes and pensions to her Ministers. Immersed
in pleasure and cool to ambition, gentle, too, to her
subjects, it is not credible that the Armies she
poured on the King of Prussia’s dominions were
dispatched by feelings of her own. The danger
was not the less pressing to the King. The Russians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
again threatened him; advanced again. The
desultory Swedes still hovered over him. The
Austrian force was complete and numerous; and,
if Daun was too cautious, Laudohn promised to
repair by activity the Marshal’s circumspection.</p>

<p>The Court of Vienna seemed to applaud Laudohn’s
vigour, whether to animate Daun by giving him a
rival, or really wishing for an opportunity to fling
the command into hands more alert. The Marshal,
who preferred the interests of his mistress to his own
glory, was not to be provoked out of his prudence.
Inferior forces, he seemed to think, might be justified
in rashness: superior strength, that could command
time, could also ensure success; and, as his conduct
had already brought the King of Prussia to the
verge of ruin, he saw no cause to precipitate measures
which had and did tend so naturally to
complete the work. The King, whom experience
had successively taught to be brave, to be desperate,
to be circumspect, was not impatient to advance his
fate. His whole conduct in this campaign evidenced
that he looked on his situation as little less than
hopeless; firm, however, to find an issue, if art or
industry could furnish one. He entrenched himself
strongly between the Elbe and the Multa, covering
Saxony. Prince Henry defended Silesia; General
Fouquet, preserving a communication with the
latter, was posted near Glatz. Daun watched the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
King in a camp no less strong; while Laudohn,
with a light army, shifted his quarters, and by
turns threatened Silesia and Berlin&mdash;sometimes
hovered over the strong places in Silesia, at others
made a feint of attacking Prince Henry. The
storm, however, at length seemed levelled against
Schweidnitz. General Fouquet was the dupe of
that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mouvement</i>; and, marching to cover the town,
was drawn into an engagement by Laudohn near
Landshut, in which the Prussians were not only
totally defeated, but Fouquet himself, with two other
Generals, four Colonels, two hundred and thirteen
officers, and seven thousand men, were obliged to
lay down their arms and surrender themselves
prisoners.</p>

<p>Laudohn, eager to improve his victory, besieged
Glatz and took it. He was of a nature not to stop
in the career of success. The King trembled for
Silesia; while, at the same time, he was kept in
check by Daun’s superior force. He had no longer
leisure to temporize. By a secret and rapid march he
crossed the Elbe before the Marshal had notice of
his departure. But Daun, however wary, was not
dilatory. He followed the King with an expedition
which, being assisted by having a shorter cut to
make, soon gave him the start of his Majesty. This
was the point at which the King had pushed.
When he found that the Marshal was advanced before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
him by a march of two days, the King turned
suddenly back, and, while he was supposed on the
borders of Silesia, appeared before the walls of
Dresden. He commenced the siege with ardour;
for it would admit of no delay. The glory of outwitting
Daun was all the fruit reaped by this
stratagem; and, unless the King flattered himself
with a prospect of carrying Dresden by surprise or
storm, his manœuvre was, in his circumstances, a
puerile stratagem, a game of generalship not adequate
to the crisis of his fortune. It seemed one of those
vainglorious littlenesses which too often entered into
his composition. The same mistaken appetite of
applause tempted him in this very campaign to
publish his poems; a superficial medley, ungrateful
to the Deity that had given him such talents, and
who had not given him a genius for poetry. Achilles
was a subject for Pindar’s lyre, but could not strike
it like Pindar.</p>

<p>Daun soon compensated for his error, and reached
Dresden in six days after the siege was formed.
He flung sixteen battalions into the town; and in
three days more the King abandoned the siege.
He had astonished Europe&mdash;and he was satisfied.
His brother’s glory was more solid. Laudohn had
invested Breslau, and expected to be joined by
seventy thousand Russians. The town in the meantime
was battered with incredible fury. The Russians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
did not appear&mdash;but Prince Henry did. He
had marched from Glogau with surprising expedition,
and arrived in time to save the place.
Laudohn thought fit to decamp without risking a
battle; but he blocked up Neisse and Schweidnitz;
and the Russians at last advanced. Three bodies
of Austrians also joined, commanded by Daun,
Laudohn, and Lacy. The King by large strides
hastened to the defence of Silesia, and encamped at
Lignitz. His own superiority of force, and the
approach of the Russians, appeared to Marshal
Daun the favourable moment for determining the
contest. He disposed his plan for attacking the
King in different quarters with all the three Armies;
and, to leave as little as possible to chance, he
meant to surprise him in the night. Measures so
wisely taken were frustrated by the vivacity of the
King. He had learned the approach of a body of
Russians, and saw himself in a net. In vain had
he already attempted to divide the Austrian Armies;
but what his stratagems could not effect, their own
disposition offered to him. Meaning to surround
him, they necessarily were to act in detached
bodies. He seized the lucky hour with vigour and
sagacity; and, on the evening before the destined
general attack, he silently quitted his position, and
seized a post through which Laudohn was to pass.
Daun had begun to move, when, to his inexpressible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
surprise, he found no enemy to encounter. The
astonishment of Laudohn was not less, when, at
three in the morning, he found himself opposed to
the whole force of the King of Prussia. He was
fallen into the snare, and it was too late to retreat.
For three hours he sustained the redoubled onsets
of the Prussian; but the King, who fought to
avoid a battle, as well as to gain one, exerted such
desperate heroism, that at length he totally routed
the Austrians. They fled, leaving the Monarch in
possession of every mark of victory, but expecting
each moment to have it ravished from him.</p>

<p>Here, if ever, Marshal Daun seems to have hesitated
unwisely. The Prussians were flushed with
success; but such a victory was not gained without
fatigue. Daun suspended his blow, and never recovered
the opportunity: he lost it by waiting to
ensure it. Never trusting to chance, while additional
strength was in view, he detached a strong
corps to meet the Russians and press them to advance.
Great as the reinforcement was, it did not
counterbalance the panic with which they were
struck by Laudohn’s defeat. They repassed the
Oder with precipitation, and left the King at liberty
to join Prince Henry. Marshal Daun, who was
more lessened by his competitor’s defeat than he
could have been by any triumph of Laudohn, descended
from the lofty hopes he had so reasonably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
entertained, and blockaded Schweidnitz. But the
honour of forming a single siege was soon ravished
from him by Frederick, who, having surprised and
vanquished a corps under General Beck, obliged
the Marshal to raise the blockade and retreat precipitately
to the mountains.</p>

<p>Still dangers crowded on the King as fast as he
dispersed them. While he was defending Silesia,
the Russians, seeing Brandenburg open, turned
their invasion towards that province. Count Czernichew
led on a considerable body; Daun sent
them 15,000 Austrians, and the Imperial Army in
Saxony was ordered to meet them at the gates of
Berlin. Count Halsen had upheld the sinking fortune
of the King in Saxony: he was now commanded
to make an effort for saving Berlin; but
when he had assembled all possible force, it amounted
but to 15,000 men. With such scanty means, he
could only be witness to the reduction of the capital,
which immediately capitulated. The Allied Army
laid the town under heavy contribution; but the
Russians, who had not distinguished themselves in
that war by lenity, blushed to see themselves surpassed
by the excesses of the Austrians; so much
did animosity surpass barbarism. Even the Swedes
had hoped to come in for share of the plunder of
Berlin, and were stretching thither.</p>

<p>The King, whose fortune sunk wherever he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
not in person to sustain it, marched to relieve his
capital. The plunderers did not await him, but,
after wasting the country, retired; the Imperialists,
to profit of the King’s absence, and to seize Saxony,
which lay at their mercy; the Russians, to form
the siege of Colberg, which, however, they abandoned,
and retreated. Laudohn had no better success
before Cosel: and before the end of the campaign,
the Swedes, too, were driven back by the
alertness of General Werner.</p>

<p>Still Marshal Daun’s Army remained entire, and
superior to the King’s. He had followed and watched
every motion of that Prince, and both passed the
Elbe on the same day. The two Armies encamped
near Torgau; the Marshal with every advantage of
position. The King’s situation was tremendous.
The enemy was not to be forced from a post so
judiciously chosen. Winter advanced; and Frederic
had nothing but a ruined country to receive
him, if defeated. The King saw the gulph that
surrounded him. He saw the fruitlessness of disguising
their danger to his Army. He determined
to fight, and told his troops that he was resolved to
conquer or die. Under the awfulness of despair,
they attacked the enemy. The onset and the reception
became the renown of such Armies and
such Commanders. Fury animated the Prussians;
intrepidity sustained the Austrians. The King’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
valour was correspondent to his declaration. The
Marshal showed that his fire had been restrained
by wisdom alone&mdash;not by want of heroism. The
event was long in suspense, and fluctuated alternately,
each side being often repulsed, and returning
to the charge with fresh alacrity. The Prussians
at last threw the enemy into disorder; and
the Marshal himself receiving a dangerous wound
in the thigh, and being borne from the field, Count
O’Donnel, who succeeded to the command, found it
vain to dispute the field any longer. It was nine
at night in the month of November; the battle had
lasted from two in the afternoon. A retreat was
sounded, and made in good order by the Austrians.</p>

<p>Dearly did the Prussians buy their victory; but
in such a crisis what was too dear a price for
Frederic to pay? His loss was computed at 13,000
men. The Austrians had not suffered less; in
prisoners abundantly. Four Generals, 216 officers,
and 8000 private men taken, with possession of the
field, were decisive in favour of the Prussians.
The recovery of all Saxony, but Dresden, made the
victory indisputable.</p>

<p>Prince Ferdinand’s campaign was not alike resplendent
in action or variety. His army had been
reinforced, but was still inferior to the French commanded
by Marshal Broglio. A separate corps was
under the orders of Count St. Germain, an officer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
of reputation, but between whom and Broglio an
enmity subsisted, which made it thought unadvisable
to let them act together. That they should
even act in concert was little to be expected&mdash;nor
did they. Prince Ferdinand reaped security from
their dissensions rather than laurels. Their animosities
ran so high, that Broglio ordering St.
Germain to join his force with the Grand Army,
contrary to the compact which the latter had made
of commanding a distinct body, St. Germain, who
was also an older officer, threw up his commission,
and quitted the service of his country.</p>

<p>The Hereditary Prince, ever alert, had attacked
a post, been beaten, and been wounded. He soon
compensated for that disgrace by surprising another
detachment, in which he made the General who
commanded it, and 3000 men, prisoners. That
success was followed by a more considerable action
at Warbourg, in which the French were again
worsted by Prince Ferdinand and his heroic nephew:
yet so little advantage was reaped by that achievement,
that the French soon overran Hesse, seized
Göttingen and Munden, and were at the eve of
possessing Hanover.</p>

<p>The Hereditary Prince continued his eccentric
enterprises with advantage. His ardour was well
seconded by the bravery of the English troops: yet
those flying rencounters rather kept off than forwarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
any decisive blow. Prince Ferdinand made
other detachments with like prosperity; and gained
at least the glory of diverting Broglio, with very
superior force, from accomplishing any point of importance.
A more unaccountable expedition, on
which Prince Ferdinand suddenly dispatched his
nephew, at the head of a considerable force, towards
the frontiers of Holland, occasioned much solicitude
in England, as the main Army, already unequal to
that of France, was thus rendered much weaker.
King George felt it with anxiety; and though not
productive of the disasters apprehended, it was far,
whatever were the object of its destination, from
turning to account. Cleves, indeed, fell into our
hands, and the siege of Wesel was undertaken; but
the French not thinking fit to leave the Hereditary
Prince undisturbed in his progress, sent Monsieur
de Castries, with a powerful detachment, to interrupt
the siege. The Prince, whose characteristic
was quickness, did not wait to be compelled to raise
the siege. He attempted to surprise the enemy,
but was repulsed with loss, and received another
wound.</p>

<p>In that action fell Lord Downe,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> a gallant young
man, adorned with every amiable quality. Intrepid,
generous, and good-natured, he had abandoned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
enjoyment of an ample fortune for the pursuit of
arms, to which he had an ungovernable impulse.
He had parts to have distinguished him in a safer
scene; and a peculiarity of humour that ornamented
even his virtues. He received three wounds, and
languished some weeks in torment, which he supported
with indifference to everything but the impatience
of returning to his profession&mdash;but his
wounds were mortal. The Prince rejoined the
Army, which soon after went into winter-quarters.</p>

<p>While the theatre of war was thus open to men
so formed to shine on it, another hero, who had
been excluded from the scene, was in a melancholy
condition. The Duke of Cumberland in the summer
had a stroke of palsy. He soon recovered
both his speech and limbs; but the grossness of his
constitution, and other disorders, made his friends
apprehend he would not long survive it. Himself
treated it with indifference, and with the same
philosophy with which his high spirit had supported
misfortunes to him more sensible.</p>

<p>The martial temper of the age called forth a champion
of dissimilar complexion. There was in Ireland
an Earl of Clanrickard, who, even in this
country, where singular characters are not uncommon,
had been reckoned more than ordinarily
extravagant. The Duke of Bedford had refused to
let him raise a regiment. To prove his valour, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
challenged the Lord-Lieutenant, who contemning
so improper an adversary, the Earl printed in the
public papers a letter to the Duke, reproaching him
with rejecting the challenge, and reflecting both on
his Grace and his secretary, whose bones he threatened
to break. Such an insult on the chief governor
of a kingdom was atrocious. The Privy Council
of England ordered the Attorney-General to commence
a prosecution against the Earl. Mr. Rigby,
whose spirit was more questionless than the Earl’s,
returned a challenge for himself; but the Earl
thought it safest to confine his prowess to the
master, and forbore coming to England. Three
years afterwards, when Rigby went to Ireland to
qualify for a place, the Privy Council of that kingdom
obliged Lord Clanrickard to give security for
his good behaviour; and the matter was compromised.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These were the last events in the long and memorable
reign of George the Second&mdash;a reign that
had produced as great statesmen, orators, and
heroes as dignify the annals of whatever country.
His thirteen first years were stamped with every
blessing of peace, but unanimity&mdash;if disagreement is
an evil to a free country, to which jealousy is perhaps
essential. A Rebellion and two wars called forth
all our resources: the disgrace that attended the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Councils and prosecution of the first war served but
to illustrate the abilities of the nation, which, reviving
from its ignominy and calamities, carried the
glory of our arms and measures to a height unknown
in our story. The Prince himself was
neither accessary to the one or the other. His
greatest merit was bearing either fortune with
calmness. Triumphant as Elizabeth and Anne, he
neither presumed on the zeal of his subjects like the
first, nor was so like the last as to concur in or
behold an ignominious peace, that tarnished such
conspicuous victories, and squandered such irrecoverable
advantages. Full of years and glory, he
died without a pang, and without a reverse. He
left his family firmly established on a long-disputed
Throne, and was taken away in the moment that
approaching extinction of sight and hearing made
loss of life the only blessing that remained desirable.</p>

<p>On the 25th of October he rose as usual at six,
and drank his chocolate; for all his actions were
invariably methodic. A quarter after seven he
went into a little closet. His German <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">valet de
chambre</i> in waiting, heard a noise, and running in,
found the King dead on the floor. In falling, he
had cut his face against the corner of a bureau.
He was laid on a bed and blooded, but not a drop
followed: the ventricle of his heart had burst.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Princess Amelie was called, and told the King
wanted her. She went immediately, and thought
him in a fit. Being deaf herself, she saw nothing
in the chamber that indicated his being dead; and
putting her face close to his, to hear if he spoke to
her, she then first perceived he was lifeless.</p>

<p>The character of this Prince has been so amply
displayed in the course of this work, that it were
tautology to recapitulate it. His faults were more
the blemishes of a private man than of a King.
The affection and tenderness he invariably showed
to a people over whom he had unbounded rule,
forbid our wondering that he used circumscribed
power with moderation. Often situated in humiliating
circumstances, his resentments seldom operated
when the power of revenge returned. He bore
the ascendant of his Ministers, who seldom were his
favourites, with more patience than he suffered any
encroachment on his will from his mistresses. Content
to bargain for the gratification of his two predominant
passions, Hanover and money, he was
almost indifferent to the rest of his royal authority,
provided exterior observance was not wanting; for
he comforted himself if he did not perceive the
diminution of Majesty, though it was notorious to
all the rest of the world. Yet he was not so totally
careless of the affection and interests of this country
as his father had been. George the First possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
a sounder understanding and a better temper: yet
George the Second gained more by being compared
with his eldest son, than he lost if paralleled with
his father. His treatment of his second son, to
whose valour he was indebted for the preservation
of his Crown, and to the silence and tenderness of
whose duty he owed the preservation of his honour,
was punished by the ingratitude of the Princess of
Wales.</p>

<p>Bookish men have censured his neglect of literature&mdash;a
reflection that at least is evidence that
public utility is not the sole purport of their labours.
But the advantages resulting to their country from
authors must be better ascertained, before the imputation
becomes a grave one. Had he pensioned
half a dozen poets, and reaped their incense, the
world had heard of nothing but his liberality. Let
Kings prefer a Tillotson or a Seneca, nay, a Bacon
or a Newton&mdash;if Bacon or Seneca will not forget
their philosophy. Let them enrich such angelic
men, when there are such angelic men, as Dr.
Hales:<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> but money is as well hoarded as squandered
on Boileaus and Benserades, on Atterburys and Drydens.
In truth, I believe King George would have
preferred a guinea to a composition as perfect as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Alexander’s Feast. He certainly did not spare
rewards to those who served their country. The
profusion of favours which he suffered the Duke
of Newcastle to shower on the University of Cambridge
ought to disculpate the King from the
charge of neglecting literature&mdash;it was the fault
of that body if they were not learned.</p>

<p>If dying but moderately rich were as good a
proof that he had not been avaricious, one of the
greatest stains of his character would be effaced.
By his will he gave fifty thousand pounds between
his three surviving children, the Duke, Princess
Amelia, and Mary, Princess of Hesse: a strong box,
not to be opened, to Lady Yarmouth. The rest of
his private fortune he had given by a deed, executed
soon after the battle of Culloden, and unrevoked,
to the Duke of Cumberland; who thence
became heir to his jewels (sold afterwards to the
successor for about fifty thousand pounds), and to
his mortgages in Germany, amounting to about an
hundred and fourscore thousand more:&mdash;a scanty
pittance, if compared with what he must have
amassed in a reign of three and thirty years. For
part of that term he had received yearly to his own
use an hundred thousand pounds from the civil
list, and never less than fifty thousand; relinquishing
the rest to the disposal of his Ministers for necessary
services! At his accession he was worth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
three hundred thousand pounds. The revenues of
Hanover exceeded five hundred thousand pounds a
year; a sum he by no means expended. Reduce
his savings to the lowest, discount his purchases,
and swell Lady Yarmouth’s legacy, which was given
out to be ten thousand pounds, to four times that
sum; and allow two millions, which his last war is
said to have cost him in defence of Hanover; it
will still be difficult to believe that he did not die
worth three hundred and fifty thousand pounds&mdash;what
became of the rest, or how concealed if there
was more, I pretend not to determine, nor even to
guess.</p>

<p>The King himself had stated his late expense for
Hanover still higher than I have set down. Mr.
Onslow, the Speaker, showed me a remarkable paper,
which had been brought to him at the King’s command,
in the year 1758, by Baron Munchausen,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
with whom Mr. Onslow had no acquaintance. In
that memorandum, the King declared that he had
then expended on the war 2,500,000<em>l.</em>, the savings
of thirty years; that he had borrowed above
200,000<em>l.</em> here in England, as much more in Germany,
and that the Hanoverian Chancery of war
owed 200,000 rix dollars. “The King,” concluded
the paper, “can do no more himself towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
war.”&mdash;If he did more in the two following years,
and it has never been pretended that he stopped
his hand in 1758, his remaining ability to go on
induces a suspicion that there was as little exactness
observed in stating the rest of the account. On the
envelope of Munchausen’s paper Mr. Onslow had
written, “I could send no answer to this.”</p>

<p>The morning after the King’s death, the Duke of
Cumberland sent for Lord Waldegrave, and told
him, that if, as Lady Yarmouth believed, no new
will had been made since that in Princess Amelie’s
hands, his father had done greatly for him&mdash;not,
however, so largely as he had once purposed: he
had said to the Duke, “William, I see you will
never marry; it is in vain to think of making a
great establishment of a new branch through you:
I shall do well for you for your life; yet not so
large as I should have done in that case.” This
certainly intimated a project of leaving his purchased
Principalities in Germany to the Duke.</p>

<p>Lord Waldegrave in return showed his Royal
Highness an <em>extraordinary</em> piece; it was endorsed,
<em>very private paper</em>, and was a letter from the
Duke of Newcastle to the first Earl of Waldegrave;
in which his Grace informed the Earl,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> that he had
received by the messenger the copy of the will and
codicil of George the First; that he had delivered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
it to his Majesty, who put it into the fire without
opening it&mdash;“so,” adds the Duke, “we do not
know whether it confirms the other or not:” and
he proceeds to say, “I dispatch a messenger to the
Duke of Wolfenbuttle with the treaty, in which is
granted all he desires; and we expect by the return
of the messenger the original will from him.”
George the First had left two wills; one in the
hands of Dr. Wake, Archbishop of Canterbury, the
other with the Duke of Wolfenbuttle. The Archbishop,
on news of the King’s death, carried his copy
to the Privy Council, and, without the precaution
of opening it before them, which the poor man could
not apprehend would be so necessary as it proved,
gave it into the new King’s hands, who, to the Prelate’s
great surprise, carried it from Council <em>unopened</em>.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
The letter I have quoted above shows
what was the fate of the other copy: the honest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Duke of Wolfenbuttle sold it for a subsidy! George
the First had been in the right to take those precautions:
he himself had burned his wife’s testament,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
and her father’s, the Duke of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Zell'">Zelle</ins>, both of
whom had made George the Second their heir&mdash;a
palliative of the latter’s obliquity, if justice would
allow of any violation.</p>

a Baron of England, and Commander-in-Chief of the Forces
of Great Britain, from which post he was removed in 1782,
was one of those men who, in particular circumstances, in
one period of their life have performed not only great
actions, but have conducted them with consummate sense
and address, and who in the rest of their lives have been
able to display no symptoms of genius. Amherst, who
terminated the war in America with so much ability, being
afterwards raised to the command of the Army at home, was
discovered and universally allowed to be a man of incapacity,
or neglectful of the most common details of his office.
Whether conscious of his own defects, and of being incompetent
to converse with men whom he knew enlightened,
he seemed determined to bury his deficiency in obstinate
silence; or else his pride and vanity, of which he had a tolerable
share, made him disdain to communicate his paucity of
ideas. No satisfaction could be extorted from him on whatever
business he was consulted; nor was it much easier to
obtain from him the necessary orders in his department. In
1779, when the French Fleet arrived off Plymouth, he could
not have given more absurd directions had he meant to betray
the place; and, when every part of the coast was open
to expected invasion, he was nowhere prepared with the
common necessaries for taking the field. When reproached
in Parliament with his negligence and insufficiency, he confirmed
them by the sullen and inadequate brevity of his reply.
When at last he was removed by the preponderance of the
Opposition in 1782, he fell as unregretted as he had remained
in place despised.

General Monk had been another of those temporary brilliants.
All the depths of refined policy had seemed to have
conducted and ensured his success. After the Restoration,
not a gleam of genius appeared, though he proved just the
reverse of Amherst. Monk had observed the most <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'profound secresy'">profound
secrecy</ins> and dissimulation in conducting the re-establishment
of the King. He seems to have thrown off all disguise in
the rest of his life; though his activity remained, whenever
called out. Amherst assumed reserve when he had nothing
to conceal, and laid aside industry when it would have sufficed
to communicate vigour to others. When men shine but
once, it is probable that fortune has the chief merit in their
success; and that others impute to their foresight the lucky
combinations of chance in their favour.

<p>
In different parts of these Memoirs I am well aware that I
have given very different characters of some of the principal
actors. The reason is, that, having observed them well
for a long series of years, I have seen cause to change my
opinions&mdash;perhaps the persons themselves altered, for who is
consistent? I choose to leave the portraits with their variations;
I think they were just at each period in which they
were drawn&mdash;the reader must judge from the conduct of the
persons; for he will observe, that, if I vary my accounts, I
produce the instances in which the actors appear different
from themselves. Lord Chatham I have described in all the
lights in which he appeared&mdash;sometimes a capital statesman,
and sometimes an empiric. The Duke of Cumberland I have
shown to have become a most wise, philosophic, and respectable,
from a haughty and insolent Prince. Lord George
Sackville I have spoken of with admiration of his parts, with
great indecision on his spirit, with scorn of his want of judgment,
and of his want of abilities in the latter part of his
time. Lord Amherst was allowed for many years to have
deserved the encomiums I have given to his conduct in America.
The contempt conceived for him afterwards was so
general, that, even while he retained his power, he had not
an advocate.&mdash;A.

<p>
The author’s notes were generally written many years
after the text. The above unfavourable portrait of Lord
Amherst was probably annexed to the MS. at the close of
the American war, when political animosities obscured every
impartial view of living characters. The panegyric in text
was composed in 1763, Horace Walpole being then more
than ever disposed to magnify the events and extol the tactics
of the seven-years’ war. Allowance must be made for these
circumstances. We may abate something of the warmth of
encomium in the text, but we must also mitigate the bitterness
which forms so large an ingredient in the note.&mdash;E.</p></div>

<p>I learned from Henrietta, Countess of Suffolk,
mistress to George the Second, the fact mentioned
in text, of George the First burning his wife’s testament.
That Princess, the Electress of Hanover,
liked the famous Count Konigsmark, while her
husband was at the Army. The old Elector, father
of George the First, ordered him away. The Electress,
then Hereditary Princess, was persuaded to let
him kiss her hand before his departure. She saw him
in bed&mdash;he retired, and was never heard of more.
When George the Second went first to Hanover
after his father’s death, and made some alterations
in the palace, the body of Konigsmark was found
under the floor of the chamber next to the Electress’s
chamber. He had been strangled immediately
on leaving her, by the old Elector’s order,
and buried under the floor. This fact <em>Queen
Caroline related to my father</em>, Sir Robert Walpole.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
George the Second told it to his wife, but never to
his mistress, Lady Suffolk, who had never heard it
till I told it to her many years after. The Electress
was separated from George I. on that amour,
and was called Duchess of Halle; and he married
the Duchess of Kendal with his left hand. When
the French threatened Hanover in Queen Anne’s
war, the Duchess of Halle was sent to her parents,
the Duke and Duchess of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Zell'">Zelle</ins>, who doted on her
their only child, and she stayed a year with them;
but though they were most earnest to retain her,
she was forced to return to her confinement, in
which she died the year before her husband. Some
French prophetess, as supposed hired by the Duke
of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Zell'">Zelle</ins>, warned George I. to take care of his wife,
for he would not long outlive her. As the Germans
are very superstitious, he believed the prophecy;
and when he took leave of his son and the Princess
of Wales, Caroline, he told them he should never
see them more. George II., who hated his father
and was very fond of his mother, meant, if she had
survived her husband, to bring her over, and declare
her Queen Dowager. Lady Suffolk told me, that
the morning after the news of the death of George I.
arrived, when she went, as Woman of the Bed-chamber,
to the new Queen, she found a whole and
half-length portraits of the Electress hung up in the
apartment; George II. had had them locked up, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
had not dared to produce them. Princess Amelie
has the half-length at her house in Cavendish-square.
George I. told the Duchess of Kendal, that
if he could, he would appear to her after his death.
Soon after that event, a large bird, I forget of what
sort, flew into her window. She believed it was
the King’s soul, and took the utmost care of it.
George II. was not less credulous; he believed in
vampires. His son Frederic affected the same contradictory
fondness for his grandfather, and erected
the statue of George I. in Leicester-fields; and
intended, if he had come to the crown, to place a
monument to his memory in St. Paul’s.</p>

<p>George I., besides the Duchess of Kendal, had
several other mistresses, particularly one whom he
brought over and created Countess of Darlington;
by whom he was father of Charlotte, Viscountess
Howe, though she was not publicly avowed. In
the last year or two of his life he had another mistress,
Miss Anne Brett, daughter, by her second
husband, Colonel Brett, of the famous divorced
Countess of Macclesfield, mother of Savage, the
poet. Miss Brett had an apartment given to her
in the palace at St. James’s, and was to have been
created a Countess, if the King had returned.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
